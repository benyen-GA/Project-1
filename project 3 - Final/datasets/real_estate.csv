0,realestateinvesting,"CFP recommended ""10% rule"" for income??","In short, my wife and I are debating selling our home vs renting it out. We consulted a CFP and he ran some numbers by us that included a ""10% rule"" when determining the ""worthiness"" of renting out a property. I purchased my home for $143K in 2012, now owe 107K with a market value of \~246K. Rent will fetch about 1750/mo. He states that this is about an 8% return (21K/246K). But shouldn't the numbers used be more like 21K/143K? What does the market value have to do with my return? Shouldn't it matter more what I paid? My mortgage is 1K, so how is renting this out not a better return than using it as a down payment on my next home (theoretically a 6-7% return if I'm negating that mortgage amount, right?).

I'm just racking my brain about how this wouldn't be a good investment idea. It will be my first rental property and I feel as though it's a great way to start."

6,realestateinvesting,Buying a triplex with a partner and personally living in one of the units.,"I am considering buying a 3 family home with a business partner in Upstate New York. The plan is to do short term rentals in two of the units and I would move into the third unit. The primary reason for moving into the third unit is because the city requires Airbnb’s and other short term rentals to be your primary residence. I also already live in this city and rent currently so moving and making it my primary would be easy. It would also makes certain aspects of managing the other two units easier (and certainly more of a pain in the ass at times). We are splitting everything 50 / 50 including down payment, expenses, renovations etc

My main questions are:

-Would using an LLC to run this as a business be the best move?

-How would we approach the cost of my living in one of the units? By moving into one of the units I am allowing the income potential to be much higher.  

My assumption would be to take the market value of what the rent is in that unit and pay that into the LLC each month. Example: I pay $2,400 per month and when taking distributions / taking profits it would be split so I would essentially only be paying $1200 per month? 

Any advice is much appreciated. I also would like to know if anyone has done something similar and / or has concerns with this plan. Cheers"
7,realestateinvesting,Buying a decent-sized house in Bay Area/LA for large amount of of money and renting out all the unused space,"I saw a YouTube video a few months ago and was recently thinking about it. In the video one of the people says his friend during college got a part-time job and saved up enough money to take out a loan for a house in the Bay Area. I believe that he also had a sizable amount of money saved that he used in addition to the part time job. The house according to the person was probably a decently big house with 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. He said that he rented out all the unused rooms to help pay for the morgatage. Apparently since the demand for housing is so high in the Bay Area he was making more off of the rent than the morgatage payments were costing per month. I understand that obviously taking out a large loan on a property is risky, especially when you can barely afford to put down the money for a house. However, in an area like the Bay Area, where housing is a huge problem and prices are always increasing couldn't you buy a property now and just use the bare minimum space of 1 bedroom and 1 bathroom and rent out the rest to pay for the morgatage. Eventually, the rent could be increased to a greater total amount than the monthly morgatege than you could have a fully paid off property, while only having to spend a relatively small amount of money. Also, if you are in college there is no need for a lot of space since 1 bedroom in a house is probably more than the entire dorm-room would be. I know this idea may seem out there, but I feel like this is definitely still viable in an area, with an ever-increasing demand for housing. I would appreciate if some more professional investors could share their insight on the topic."

10,realestateinvesting,Is there a single company behind all those “We buy local houses” ads?,"You know the ones, they play on daytime tv, with a guy saying he’ll make an all-cash offer for your house. We’ve had one playing in our area for a while, but recently a second one appeared with a different guy, a different company name, but an almost identical commercial down to using the exact same backdrops. It got me wondering if they were both owned by the same parent company or something, so I googled it and found very similar companies in cities across the country. They all have similar names (“We Buy [city name] Houses” or something), similar websites, and even similar logos. A few of them even offer the same “why you should sell to a professional home buyer” guide.

I can’t find any parent company, but I’m wondering if they all went to the same training course or something? I know it’s an odd question but I’m genuinely curious where all these businesses are coming from.

15,realestateinvesting,Where to find SFR investors?,"I work for a home builder in Los Angeles and we’re looking for investors of single family homes. 

We have become heavily inundated on the spec side (150+projects) and thought we should capitalize on the land we’re seeing but not moving on. We find deals for significantly under market and would like to place investors in with our builds at discount pricing compared to market rate.

Example: 
Plan- 3k sqft home on 6k lot (5bd, 5 ba) 
Land - $1,200,000 ($1.4-1.5 value in market)
Build- $1,600,000 all in- no changes
All in- $2,800,000 (with low $2’s tax basis) 
Home value - $3,450,000

A nice little value proposition and possibly even venturing into multi unit developments for the right investors for small lot subdivisions. Where would I start to look for those types of investors? There don’t seem to be single family investor conferences. I thought property managers might be a good start but they’ve been quite reluctant to speak to their clients. We’re talking to land guys and small investors and they’re happy to take assignments but that isn’t as appealing as the build contracts for us. 

Any ideas would be appreciated."

-NNN commercial property with around 6% CAP rate

He went on and on about how much money I would save with additional tax write offs by having things set up this way, how it would be nearly bullet proof from a liability standpoint and how its much cheaper than having an LLC for each property.  He made it seem crazy to structure your properties any other way.  Anyone have any opinions on this set up and on NCH specifically?"

23,realestateinvesting,Thoughts on buying multiple rental properties 60/40 split with brother?,"Currently own two properties myself but was thinking to lower risk but also scale up faster with my brother under a LLC.

We are very close, we currently live together and share our current mortgage and living expenses 50/50 split. Never had late payment. We both earn six figures with our W2. Our only debt it our mortgage. 

We 100% agreed to do 60/40 split on new mortgage properties payments and revenue/profit. I will be doing to property management ""dirty work"" thus 60% split. 

With this, we lower our risk tremendously. Compared to a person paying 100% of everything and with the risk of not being able to profit the porperty. We have the same mindset with this strategy. We have our own LLC together. 

Would this be a business venture worthwhile? On paper it makes sense with the math: little debt, high disposable income for two people, same mindset, LLC; Or should I just continue solo and build upon my 2 other properties I have currently? While they are successful for now, I feel with less risk and less money invested in a property with my brother, I can scale up faster with him and get passive income much, much faster than on my own.

24,realestateinvesting,Looking for 2nd home in upstate NY... is owner finance the way to go?,"Hello all,

Im trying to figure the best way to go about this. I can get a loan of $50k against my 401 but beyond that dont really want to tie myself to another mortgage. The wife doesnt even like the idea, shes not from the area, has never been, and doesnt care to go, so Ive got to make this affordable.

I started to look at owner financed places. I found something that might work, a 2 family place. Asking minimum of $40k down, the rest financed at 10%

So that seems like a high interest rate.

27,realestateinvesting,What to do with this property?,"  Hello everyone, I am interested in jump-starting my career in real estate investing and would appreciate some guidance.

Currently, I own a house (California) with a monthly mortgage of $1,850 and an interest rate of 2.625%. The outstanding loan amount is $367,000, and the current market value of the property is $435,000. Based on my research and conversations with property management companies in the area, I estimate that I can rent this house for at least $2,200 to $2,500 per month.

In addition to my real estate investment, I am also running another side hustle that generates a net profit of $600 every month (under table), while working a full-time job that pays a salary of $70,000 per year.

My goal is to acquire another single-family home (SFH) this year or next year and ensure that I am adequately prepared to succeed in this endeavor. However, I am unsure of how to go about managing two mortgages under my name. Would I need to rent out my first house? If so, how would I go about demonstrating rental income to the lender to lower my debt-to-income ratio (DTI)?

I am married and have one child, with another on the way in April, so I am concerned about the process and its potential impact on my family. Is it advisable to wait and save aggressively before making any further investments?

I would appreciate any feedback and guidance on this matter. Thank you for your help."
28,realestateinvesting,Cutting My Budget Too Close or Not?,"I'm currently offering on a triplex as my first property. The asking price is $275k.

We would be moving into one of the units, and one of the tenants has a lease good till February 2024 at $700 a month (around $300-$400) under market. The other tenants will be moving out soon, but what I'm concerned about is that a vacancy will make my living expenses my entire month's pay for as long as we don't have anyone in the unit. It's doable, but cutting it very close. I do have a savings with extra if we need it.

So I guess my question is, how long does it usually take you guys to get a new tenant in? Also, is there anything we can do about the guy with the $700 lease?

30,realestateinvesting,Underperforming apartment building in trust,"My grandparents have had a 5 unit owner occupied condo building in San Diego since the 1980s, which is in a trust and I’m trying to learn more about how to wisely sell the property at some point in the next few years. I’m also concerned about getting a crippling tax bill. The fittings are quite outdated, it’s close to the coast so I have concerns about building integrity long term, and there are termites (expected I guess, but still a pain and around $40k or so to tent). Unfortunately they did not increase rents much over the years so the units are rented around 20% less than market value. We’ve been increasing them for 2 years now. It would also be quite expensive to update the interiors and we now live out of state, so holding on to it seems like a big liability although the income now is decent given the property is paid off. 

My grandmother passed last year, so it seems we have to have it reassessed for taxes. Also my grandpa no longer lives there, so no more owner occupied tax benefit. My mother is managing the property but she’s dyslexic and memory issues so… it’s probably not the best situation lol. I have 2 small kids and work full time so I also don’t have a ton of time to work on this. 

What’s the smartest move here in terms of taxes? We’d like to sell the place given the liability, but were advised that because the rents are low it would sell for less as an investment property. Is that true? How would I find a professional to advise on this? I’m familiar (sorta) with 1031 exchanges, but if we are looking for another apartment building or possibly a commercial property, where do you even begin to look?

Thanks for any feedback. I’ve been trying to learn about this for a while, but it seems complex and I’m no expert on all the laws so I’m worried I will miss something."
31,realestateinvesting,Bank is stealing money?,"My previous lender was bought out and my mortgage has been moved to a new bank since October of last year (2022). I received a letter stating that I was in shortage of escrow account by ~8,000. 

After numerous calls I found out that they had double paid my taxes for last year since taking over the account and that I’d have to pay the escrow account shortage for the next 3 months and be paid back until they sort it out. Fast forward 3 months and there’s no changes to my escrow account or monthly mortgage so I call to find out that there was no double payment and that it was just put in statements for accounting purposes. After numerous hours on the call I keep being told that the escrow account came over to the new bank in -2000 balance and that I needed to catch up. Is this possible? I no longer have access to old banks escrow account but when I had originally called I was told there was a positive balance of $7000 as of last October. 

New bank completely ignored this amount and continued to tell me they’re not sure what that is and where that money is although they do see it in in a statement on their system. I feel like I’m dealing with a lot of incompetence based on the responses I am getting. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

My share would worth 5X-8X USD in today's currencies and m^2 s after development. Currently its worth X-1.5X USD (pretty illiquid). This is my main retirement plan. 

Land appreciated 250-375% (in USD) in 10 years despite inflation and devaluation. Most appreciation occurred after the pandemic. 

I worry the intervention might be the reason behind such m^2 appreciation. Right now basic stuff like meat cost unusually high in USD. Some people say unofficial USDTRY is +40 (as opposed to 18.82). This unusual rise started in early 2022"

53,realestateinvesting,Realtor forced the lender to stop providing lending services to my brother.,"My friend has provided my contact to an agent, Claudia. My friend has worked with Claudia before.  In the past, Claudia has reached out to me about potential off-market listings. I make a lot of investment purchases periodically. Today, I reached out to Claudia, to inquire about any potential listings she may have. In addition, I had asked her for any good potential lenders. I want to have this option open, in case I decide not to purchase investment properties in cash. I was going to use Claudia to represent me in future purchases, until she did something super petty.

I had a conversation with the referred lender. Along the conversation, the topic of my brother buying a home was somehow brought up. He has been having some lending issues with his purchase. So I thought this was the perfect opportunity to refer my brother  to work with this lender. I knew this lender is capable to help my brother. However, Claudia has quickly learned from the referred lender that my brother was using a different agent to purchase the home. She even convinced me to get my brother to work with her. She harassed me to provide my brother's agent number, as it is a REO property. After I failed to provide the REO agent contact, Claudia forced my lender to stop providing lending services to my brother.

Honestly, I was starting to like Claudia. But now, I despise this situation and will refrain from using her. How wrong was it of Claudia to do this? Who is in the wrong?"

One quoted me 10% of monthly rent charge, which felt within range of what I’ve heard.

This is not a my backyard rental, so I wonder if this is considered a rip off and better if I manage it myself. Expected monthly revenue would only be enough to cover mortgage payment and barely any profit.

My question is, is this area starting to see improvement? Is this area still considered “crime hill”? Would this area be a good area for a fix and flip? Any natives or investors have any experience in the 32808 area?"

65,realestateinvesting,New to real-estate would like some advice,"Hello, have been looking to purchase my first investment property in a wisconsin college town. I have been keeping an eye on the market for something worth purchasing for about 6 months. 

I found a duplex listed for $130,000, with tenants paying $1500 a month in total. The duplex is fully rented through 2023 so I wouldn’t have to worry about finding tenants. The property is very close to college campus. 

I currently have $27,000 saved up which could cover a down payment. 

My only concern is what other expenses I would need to deal with when purchasing this property. Obviously I would have to pay for title insurance, general inspection, loan origination fees, and recording costs. I just have never purchased a home before and am wondering how much money these startup costs would total, not including a down payment. 

I have looked at the property and honestly wouldn’t have to do any major rehab or maintenance upon purchasing as 4 people already live here. I am almost ready to take out a loan but am a little intimidated by these high interest rates. 

I just wanted a second opinion on this opportunity."

76,realestateinvesting,Investment property advice needed,"Hello! My husband and I are trying to get into real estate investing. Our long term goal is to have passive income from rental properties to replace our full time jobs and rehab/flip homes on our own time. My husband works in construction (100k/year) and I'm an RN (65k/yr.) We have a primary home and owe 280k, it's valued at 500k. We have a HELOC for 112k. We just bought our first property with our heloc and we're trying to figure out if we should cash out refinance it, pay off the heloc, and rent it out, or sell it, pay of the heloc, and keep the profit in an account to start a nest egg. Right now we only have about 12k in savings. If we rent it out, we will be able to make about 1000/month. If we sell it, we will probably walk away with 69k after all of the fees. I'm having a hard time figuring out which way will get us to our goal (quitting our jobs and doing real estate full time) the quickest. We would like to do a mix of flipping and renting. Things to consider: we only qualify for a 300k home loan based on our income. If we cash out refinance this property, our loan will be about 110k, only leaving room for maybe 1 or 2 more homes. Is it best to use those loan approvals now while we have our 9-5 jobs? Is it best to flip the first few to build up a higher savings account? Thank you so much for any and all perspectives!!"
77,realestateinvesting,Where to get first real estate property?,"My husband 39M does not own a home just yet. We will be renting for about 4 more years due to me going to school in a different state (and we don't know if we will stay in that state once I graduate). 

He however does want to go ahead and have an investment property. He has a credit score of 730, that is expected to go up as he took on business loans he has been able to pay back. Aside from the business loans he is currently using, no debt. 

Where should we get a real estate property is the question. We are originally from Florida. However the market here has gotten very costly, not to mention we are concerned about the climatic disasters from the hurricanes/flooding. 

We have heard great things about rental property investment in Michigan, Oaklahoma City, and North-South Carolina, but again, we are not too sure based on me going to school in the west coast, those would be too far. We could possibly be open to something in Florida if anyone knows of a good area that is relatively safe from the flooding zone.

With downpayment + closing costs he wants to put down about 60-70k.

Thank you!"

Out of curiosity I asked my neighbor to look these properties up and she said they are in a ""family trust"" but I suspect that these properties are owned by our city. If it is property owned by the city why would the city want to conceal that?
There are also several properties sprinkled here and there throughout my town that I'm learning are city property (and listed as such). They are just lots that the city has purchased, usually tore the home down, if there was one there, and then proceed to ignore the lot and allow it to become an overgrown eyesore for the next 20+ years.

98,realestateinvesting,Process to get permitting for addition (see odds of approval) before buying property?,"Hello all, 

I am looking at a Triplex for sale in Cuyahoga County (Cleveland, Oh). I am interested in it because it has a large third floor attic but it’s only 8 feet tall and slants down on the edges. It’s a commercial building that used to be retail units, converted to townhouses. 

I was wondering what the process would be like to rip the roof off and make it a complete third floor with a flat roof. On the roof, make a deck, bar, hot tub, etc. 

Obviously, this would need permitting and approval. I don’t want the property if I can’t do this desired plan. I am not even sure it’s feasible honestly. Would my best option be getting a professional engineering company to let me know if it’s possible? I don’t want to waste money finding out only for the county/city to deny the plans. Should I just reach out the city building/permitting dept. and see what they say?

If anyone has experience doing something like this in Cleveland area please let me know! 

Thanks in advance!"
99,realestateinvesting,Owner Occupied Triplex,"Looking for some validation or a get the hell out from this community. About me: flipped my first property in 2018 used that money to purchase a condo that my wife and I currently live in. We are pretty handy - I’m an electrical engineer but come from a family of contractors. My family owns a small plumbing and electrical company so I grew up rewiring houses, troubleshooting, re-pipes, tub to shower conversions etc. My wife has an excellent eye for design and has a way to turn any space into something very desirable. 
 
Recently a triplex came to market that may allow us to live basically mortgage free while upgrading our living situation. It features 2- 1/1’s, and a 3/2 where 2 of the bedrooms are in a finished basement. All three units have separate utilities except for water. It was built in 1975 as SFH and over the years the ADU’s have been added to the main structure. It is not perfect but it’s on a beautiful in town lot of 0.5 acre with gardens, new roof, new HVAC in the 3/2, new water heater. Nice curb appeal and character. However 2 out of 3 HVAC units are outdated, there is a fuse box for 1 unit, and lots of general maintenance that needs to happen. 

The plan is to rent out our current condo and owner occupy the larger 3/2 unit in the triplex. This larger unit includes a mostly finished basement that we would like to convert into an in-law suite and use as STR and a place for guests to stay. I estimate ~$15k to add a kitchen, flooring, furniture, and other items to make it attractive. The long term play will be to STR the top and bottom halves of the 3/2 while maintaining long term rentals in the 1/1’s. 

We plan to owner occupy for 3 years. Below are the numbers for our current place + the triplex. My thought is that living here will allow us to lower our living costs and save money for  a home while owning an appreciating asset that we’ll eventually use to offset the mortgage on another property. Using the owner occupied space as a STR will net $1800 in todays market, bringing the cashflow to ~$1200/mo.

Does this seem like a smart idea?

Current house (condo)
Purchase price 230k, 20% down, 3.625%
PITI = $1212
HOA = $325
Rent = $2200
Vacancy, Capex, Maint (7%) = $154
Cash flow = $509

Triplex
Purchase price 631k, 20% down, 7.49%
PITI = $4215 (est)
Rent total = $4450
Rent Unit 1 = $0 (owner occ)
Rent Unit 2 = $1350 (long term lease currently at $1090)
Rent Unit 3 = $1300 (month to month, currently at $1090)
Rent Basement STR = $1800 
Vacancy, Capex, Maint (15%) = $668
Utilities = $210
Cash flow = -($643) (while owner occupying)

Adding both properties together cashflow = - $134/mo"

109,realestateinvesting,Should I make that move?,"Hello RE Investors,

In sincere need of your advise for my strategy below.

\--------------------------------------------------

**Current scenario:**

* 1 primary home --&gt; valued at around $500,000 - $550,000
* 1 investment property (town home) --&gt; valued at around $250,000 with a positive cash flow of $200
* Single income, and no kids. 

\--------------------------------------------------

**Strategy:**

1. Sell the primary home for around $500,000ish (based on the market value) and downsize our living to a 2-bedroom apartment in a nice locality near downtown
2. Take the net proceeds (after remaining mortgage, broker fees etc., HE loan payment) around $120,000
3. Invest that $120,000 in 2 more town homes around the same range ($250,000 each) with a cashflow

\--------------------------------------------------

**Goal:**  
Selling my 1-Liability (primary home), and investing in 2-Assets (investment properties). At the end of this, I'd like to have 3 investment properties (3 assets) that cash flows   
\--------------------------------------------------

**Points supporting this decision:**

1. Current mortgage has gone up (close to $3000/month - PITI)
2. We need a better bigger home in the future - a dream home for which we can wait and save more (if we downsize now)
3. Want to build assets now by taking risk as we don't have kids now.

\--------------------------------------------------  


Do you think this is a good strategy to take in the current market? Am I being greedy here or playing the game right? Am I letting go of my current house to buy something new that I never know how it's going to perform?

117,realestateinvesting,Rant about realtors,"I applied for a HELOC in final months of 2022.. it was around this time that the market looked concerning and sales were down a lot. Realtors were sending personalized emails, checking in, calling casually.. it's obvious that they weren't making money anymore. After I applied, literally the next day, I received non-stop calls and texts (100 + calls). It was so bad that I couldn't even be on my phone without getting interrupted. I thought it would be done after that day. It didn't stop for days. I answered a few and they knew that my phone was blowing up. After a few weeks it finally slowed down, after responding that I was not interested to most of them. 

But some of them were just part of automated systems, programmed to call within specific time windows and from random numbers. I answered one just a few weeks ago and the guy was a real estate agent and very nice.. at first. I said I really wasn't interested anymore and I had applied several months ago anyway. He immediately hung up - obviously very frustrated by my (very polite) response. If that guy didn't pretend to be nice and suddenly become an asshole, I wouldn't be writing this. But I suspect this is nearly every realtor.

To this day, I still get 3-6 calls a day.. automated systems that I have no clue how to get off of. I answer and it's nothing and goes blank. They're ""respectful"" enough to at least only do this on weekdays. 

Obviously, my info was sold to these lenders/realtors without me knowing when I applied for the HELOC. I'm a real estate investor and I frankly don't value the job of a realtor. I don't think they should make the money that they brag about for the basic duties that they cover. Back in the day, it made sense to have a realtor. Nowadays it's common knowledge and not worth 2.5% + commission. (Unless you're selling really expensive houses like 5M+  - I do get that bc transaction time is slow)

I am actually glad that these people are struggling - you put this on yourself for helping manipulate prices, descriptions, etc. They brag about making $40k in a month for the last 2 years of the pandemic and now want sympathy? I have nothing against making money, I'm a high earner myself, but I don't own a Porsche, tell people how much I make, or lie to people to make a sale. 

And even when I purchased my home in 2020 it wasn't even a good experience - slow responses from seller side, missing information -- it was clear that they were just busy working with as many clients as possible to get that commission. Who wouldn't I guess doing this job.

Realtors. It wasn't up until these nonstop calls that I really got fed up. Your job is BS and I'm glad that it's not going well for most of you right now and I hope it never does again. I think innovation will one day help eliminate these jobs and be more transparent to the people that actually buy homes. In 2020 (reverting back) and beyond, knowing the good/bad about a house shouldn't even be an issue, and new construction homes should have zero defects. Humanity has been building shelter for thousands of years and common homes for hundreds. There should be zero issues ever.

Btw, this is the only negative ""review"" I've ever posted. Normally would not put the effort into something like this but ya'll won't leave me the F#@K alone."

I have enough equity in 1 of my properties to pull out a $100k HELOC. In addition, I'd feel comfortable throwing in another $50k cash out of pocket. Maybe even $100k cash if I wait a few more months.

How can I best use this to scale? My dream scenario would be to buy a 10-20 unit multifamily, at \~$1-1.5M (for context, there's a 20-unit MF that's been sitting in my market for 10 months at $1.6M). However, I'd settle for something smaller (i.e. a 5-plex) if that's all I can do, but I definitely want to keep scaling this year. 

How would you more experienced investors utilize this $100k HELOC + $50k cash to scale? 

P.S- In case it matters, have good day job that pays \~$150k-$175k/yr and aside from mortgages, no debt. Mentioning this as potential ""cushion"" to fall back on if a deal takes longer than planned."
122,realestateinvesting,Anybody have experience with Chicago Realty Group LLC?,"Hi everyone

I want to rent my house in Chicago’s western suburbs. Searching through bigger pockets, I’ve found a guy named Sean Morrisey from a property management firm called Chicago realty group.

According to their website, they were awarded as the best property management group of Aurora, IL in 2021 by expertise.com.

They also seem to work with surevestor.

I don’t know much about expertise.com but I’ve heard about surevestor through MeetKevin’s channel in YouTube. But no idea how easy or hard it is to work with them.

One of the things which makes think twice is that Sean Morrisey has once attended a podcast with Clayton Morris who has been subject to lawsuits etc.

So I was wondering whether if anyone has worked with this firm and how has their experience been?

Thanks"

124,realestateinvesting,I have a condemned residential property- What would you do?,"Bit of a long story- I inherited a condemned residential property in Illinois after my father passed away. Built in the early 1900's. 2 story, single family, fieldstone basement. Well and septic, but annexed into the city. It's on 1/2 acre. Old farmhouse, commercial area built around it over the years. I also own the 1 acre parcel next to it which has an old barn on it. Important point from a value perspective: it is about 40' from commuter/freight train tracks. 

This house flooded like 30 years ago. My dad took the insurance money, dumped it into something else and let the place rot. It has NOT been officially condemned by any government agency. Now it's inhabited by raccoons and bugs. I don't spend much time inside, but think scary condemned. Like nervous to walk in for fear of falling through the floor.

What should I do with it? Rehab it into a liveable residential property? Raze both lots, rezone commercial, and build a self storage facility? Looking for ideas and resources. 

TLDR: inherited a tear down resi property in a poor location. What to do?"

What advice do you have for someone who has over leveraged on rental properties? 

My situation is, I am on a work visa which means I cannot stay in the US without a (high paying tech) job. My investment so far is: every year I take the RSU, bonus, ESPP and buy a rental property every year since 2018. Few of these are cash flow positive, few of these aren’t. But I make sure the overage is never above 100$. 

I am now sitting on a portfolio of 5 rentals and 1.5 million in mortgage ranging from 3% to 7% (closed in December). But I do not have any savings on a monthly basis. 

I am hoping I will end up selling one house for each of the major expense I incur like kids education (2 kids and not planning to have more), retirement etc. I am not expecting any of these to hit me in the next 10 years at least.

Moving forward, due to slow returns on my company stocks and increased rates, if I follow the same strategy, I will be able to buy a house only once in 3/4 years."

I live in Chicago and I'm closing my investment property in NC on March 27. When I went into contract, I was told that I did not had to be physically present for closing but now they're telling me that any closing in last week of month does not have option of Mail away. Now, this has come as a surprise because I was not planning on travelling and have other work lined up in my office at that time. So my question is, Is really Mail away not an option ? What other option do I have other than hiring a closing attorney which will cost me same as flying my family here for couple of days.

We'd like to move into a bigger house with more sq ft and bigger yard, so we have been considering renting our current home and buying a bigger home.   


Our home has appreciated quite a bit. We owe $165k and market value is $475-$500k.  We have a 15-year, 2.35% mortgage (refinanced late 2021).  We are in a good neighborhood in Nashville (growing city with a lot going for it) and would like to treat this as an investment property so it can continue to appreciate.  Basically we would treat it like it's part of our retirement.

If we rented our home, we believe it would fetch around $2,200 per month, conservatively.

*Correct me if I'm wrong:* From what I've read and seen, we can rent out our primary residence and sell it without paying capital gains tax If we live in it 2 of 5 years? Capital Gains tax exemption on real estate is up to $500k - married.

*Curious:*  Would it ever make sense if we started to rent out this property for 2 years, and then to sell the property to an LLC (controlled by us), so we can maximize the capital gains exemption?

[Another](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/4m-baby-boomer-homes-should-hit-market-each-year-till-2032) article suggests that 4 million former boomer homes will enter the market each year until 2036.  


I am hoping to become more educated on how concerned young investors should be with these figures. Specifically:  
1) How can you use data to convince someone that buying properties for residential renting is an effective use of money?  
2) Does this trend affect the viability balance of rural-ish vs urban ownership? (America is experiencing a [massive surge](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/immigrant-population-over-time) in immigrants, namely highly educated ones, and the general population growth is slowing, but not shrinking). Consider that boomers predominantly live in [rural areas](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/10/older-population-in-rural-america.html) and that highly educated working age people tend towards metropolitan areas

In my situation, it would allow me to have a fixed income with a better return than renting it. I could also recoup some of my initial investment up front while still writing off interest expenses etc. The only downside is that’s it’s currently locked up in a 5 year ARM at a 5.375% rate with zero money down.

186,realestateinvesting,Upstate NY - B.I.L. wants to buy a Tax Deed (?) for a house in expiring Redemption Period,"Hello All, Forgive me and my terminology as I'm not familiar with these types of transactions. 

Long story short, my BIL called me and wanted my opinion on an idea that he has to buy a Tax Deed (?) on a neighbor's house down the road in order to eventually make it his primary residence. The property is valued at \~$250k and the current owner owes about $32k in back taxes over the past few years. His redemption period expires in 4 months in July. My BIL wants the property because it has a ""nice"" house, 40 acres, and a pole barn for his wife's horses.

My BIL would essentially like to approach the owner, offer to pay his $32k in back taxes and then offer to buy the property from him for an agreed-upon price (ie. $100k). My BIL doesn't have Capital to invest, they don't have a lawyer to work with at this point, and any large downpayment that they would need would be funded with leverage - use the Equity in his current home to pay the $32k in back taxes to buy the Deed/Lien and then work with a Mortgage company to buy the property for the agreed-upon price of $100k from the current owner before selling his current home to make up the difference.

Please help me to understand these sort of transactions so that I can help him to understand that this is a bad idea since he can't afford it. I would venture a guess that he would be paying thousands to a real estate attorney, have to pay fees for the Deed/Lien Certificate and that process, have to pay the $32k in back taxes plus any extra fees/interest, and that is all before knowing whether or not a mortgage company would even give him a mortgage for the property to begin with."

189,realestateinvesting,Mortgage broker is saying cash flow isn't ideal...,"To be more specific, if you are a salaried employee making low 6 figures and on top of that you cash flow from a rental 600 a month. That 7k/year effectively becomes halved due to the tax in that bracket.

What do you think? 

Make higher mortgage payments to build equity? Or maximize for cashflow ?

Not sure how to navigate it so I'm seeing if anyone here can find some opportunity with this lead. This is in Virginia for legal reference.

Shared deed with 2 owners, I'm speaking with owner 1 and here's the plot.

 • So owner 1 financed the house and added owner 2 through a gift deed after purchasing

 • Owner 2 was supposed to live in the house and make payments towards owner 1's mortgage

 • Owner 2 has now stopped making payments and the bank is foreclosing on owner 1's defaulted loan

 • Owner 2 did this with the intent to purchase the house at auction

 • With owner 2 still on the deed, owner 1 cannot sign a deed in lieu or any other documents without owner 2's signature as well, so owner 1's hands are basically tied from a legal standpoint.

Any ways to help owner 1 in this situation and make it a deal?

To take an extreme example, if homes reach a point where only 1% of people can afford them, clearly there will be a lack of buyers, and homes don't' have any more room to appreciate while still being able to sell.

202,realestateinvesting,Favorite Business Checking / Banks?,"Hey all,

My partner and I are researching business accounts to manage our rental income &amp; expenses, and are hoping for some input on the community's favorite options. Currently, we're processing around $30,000/month in rental income, deposited via 20+ monthly ACH transfers from Apartments.com.

We prefer not to hold large sums of money in our business checking account, as returns are better when held elsewhere, so those options requiring large monthly balances kind of turn us off.

Unlimited or high inbound/outbound ACH transfers are definitely key considering the volume of inbound rent payments and outbound vendor/trade payments.

Below is a brain dump of our (ideal) requirements. Has anyone found options that are mostly in line with these items?

* Integration with my financial applications such as QuickBooks
* Free methods for tenants to pay, or free/unlimited ACH deposits via Apartments.com or similar management platforms.
* Excellent online banking:
 - Fully functional mobile *and* desktop applications
 - All banking functions available on mobile
 - Mobile check deposit with archived images of deposited checks
 - Easy, free payments to vendors
 - Free transfers to outside financial institutions

* Physical locations local to my region would be ideal (Chicago)
* Low monthly fee, with an option to avoid if certain criteria are met (minimum account balance, etc)
* Free outbound ACH payments
* Free inbound ACH payments without a cap on number of transactions
* Physical checks
* Brokerage linked
* Accrued interest on account balance would be great but not a deal breaker

Understanding we likely can't hit all of these points, we'd love to know what banks/business accounts might come close. Thanks!"

216,realestateinvesting,Is it Realistic to Rent a House on 2 acres?,"First off, please excuse my ignorance. I've always been very interested in real estate investing, however am not, and have never been a landlord. I also have only ever owned my current primary residence. 

My wife, daughter and myself all live in a rural property on just under 2 acres of land. We originally moved here with my wife and her mother, she was diagnosed with alzheimer's soon after and has since passed away. We've grown attached to the house - were even married in the back yard - but for various reasons are discussing the idea of moving.

I'm looking for advice on if it's feasible to both keep the property and buy a new primary residence. The idea would be to rent this place out. It feels like a 2 acre lot with a fairly large country house isn't the best first rental property, but at the same time we know the house and have a fantastic relationship with the neighbor.

I'm sure it would make more financial sense to sell and get a new primary residence and a beginner rental property that would make more sense, but that would also be ignoring the fact that we already have this place and want to keep it in our families estate as long as it's somewhat practical.

I do know companies that will mow the lawn, as well as snow removal services (neighbor uses both)."

228,realestateinvesting,Trying to figure out financing options for buying a farm that I don’t intend if farming myself,"Hello all. 

I live in Iowa and I'm trying to buy a small 5 acre property where I can build a house and operate a small hobby farm.  The geographic area I'm looking is very limited because I want to be in  specific school districts. Land at that size is very difficult to find since the majority of the land is owned by local farmers. 

The county has some laws that allow for farmland to be split into a residential lot + the farmland. I'm tryin to get creative in how I can find this land because I'm not confident it'll happen through traditional means. 

I'm wondering what the feasibility of buying a farmland and splitting it for myself and then re-selling the non-split portion. This process looks something like this: 

1. Buy a property &gt; 40 acres that has not been split in the past
2. Work with the county to perform a farmstead split that siphons off a maximum of 5 acres where 2 acres can be zoned residential
3. Re-sell the 35 acres

The difficulty is that I potentially don't have enough cash to cover  the entire purchase. I have about $500,000 that can be accessed, but it's possible I'd need to take a loan for $500,000 more. 

I'm wondering what financing options are available. I don't know if my situation applies for various USDA loans because I don't plan to be a farmer -- at best I would rent the remaining 35 acres until I could sell it. 

I'm also curious if anyone has experience doing this, and if so, if you can point me to any resources. I'm having difficulty finding the right words to Google. 

Thanks!"

Mortgage rate is 4 percent 30 year. Idea is about 1500 x2 in rent. Putting in the calculator. I got cash flow of 920 monthly but it only accounts for vacancy, mortgage,tax, insurance. Cap rate after 20 years is 8.6% and return 37% but are these 20year number accurate , it’s all green positive.(generally)

My roommate started throwing these terms at me with cap rate, cash on cash and I did look at it and tried to understand. Generally is there a ball park on what these number should look at? I feel like if I play it safer, property management and setting aside capital expenses will basically break even on cash flow.so does that mean I would rely on appreciation mostly? I don’t like to assume appreciation since it is a variable that I can’t really control. If I were to look at to generate income, do I look at cash on cash return? Cap rate? (My reading states to try to aim cash on cash about 15% to 20% so if anything happens it still be net positive like 8% and cap rate between 5-8%. Thank you for reading. I understand it’s not cut and dry but I need a baseline or some smarter brains to think with me other than the calculator is green.

236,realestateinvesting,Joint inheritance predicament,"Tldr; how can my father get his inheritance which is wrapped up in his sisters house without forcing her homeless. 

Hi all, odd scenario here I'm trying to help my dad look at options since his dad just passed away. 

Background: many years ago, my dad's sister was about to lose her house. My grandfather bought it so she wouldn't lose it and she's lived there ever since. Now that he's gone, since the house was in his name, my dad and his sister just inherited the house.

It gets difficult because my dad wants nothing to do with the house. He doesn't want to legally own part of it or even work up a legal thing where his sister has to pay him.

If he makes her remortgage and pay half the house out to him she will no doubt lose the house as she's not well off in the slightest. He doesn't want to have to deal with the liability part owner.

He obviously wants the inheritance his father is leaving him, but because of the weird situation with his sister he's talking about just putting the house in her name and taking whatever cash is left from his dad's accounts. (likely less than 20 percent of the estate).

I agree with him to not essentially drive his sister to be homeless but I don't think he should just hand her the entire estate because it's a slightly difficult decision. I'm wondering what kind of options he may have to get what his father wanted to leave for him to enjoy AND have his sister keep her house.

Note: My dad is retired and could use the money as well. I know he will regret it if he doesn't take any inheritance. He's made many 'I don't want to deal with this' decisions in the past decade that has cost him a lot of money.

(obviously this will affect my inheritance in the future as well so I'm partially invested. However, even if my dad got what he deserved and blew it all before passing it on to me, I'd be much happier seeing him actually enjoy it. The last few years he's had multiple medical issues and hasn't been able to start enjoying his retirement yet - he deserves a break and I will not be happy if he hands everything to his sister because it's the simplest option)"
237,realestateinvesting,Timberland,"Looking at a property for 320K range 220K acres. Has a timber report done apparently 320K worth of timber but ideally really can't start harvesting until at thinning is due in ten years. Then the next ten years harvest the rest. Timber value grows about 5% a year.

After it's all mostly cut in 20 years still have the land someone may want to build a dream vacation home.

In the meantime, can get about $12000/yr leasing maple trees to local producers.

In current use so annual taxes are like basically 0. No other ""up keep costs"" aside from LLC filing and insurance? Unlike a rental property no furnaces to break or tenants calling me (or giving up a % to manage).

The income now is just a nice sweetener pun intended but mostly it's a long term steady eddy appreciation play. Also fun to think about other uses eventually like a cell tower or wind turbines or even storage though pretty remote for the last one. Not banking on any of that but in theory that speculation is worth something to me.

I wanted to inspire all the young entrepreneurs &amp; investors who watch Reddit.

I started in 2012 with $1200 saved in my checking account. I joined the military as an E-2 and saved every dime (no joke, I never ate out, had a flip phone, etc.), I put everything I made into the Vanguard 500. I then decided to buy my first rental property for $71,500 with $20% down in late 2013. I then bought a second rental property for $67,000 in 2014. Flash forward to 2016, and I decided to leave the military. I had roughly $250,000 saved in my Vanguard and used that money for collateral to borrow another $100,000 (hard money), and flip a property. I bought it for $55,000 put in $22,000 and sold it for $130,000. I then found a mortgage broker who linked me up with an amazing commercial bank that believed in me and allowed me to grow. I started buying one rental every month for the next two years. I would buy old homes, fix them up, and then cash out refinance. Flash forward to 2022 and I reached out to a local business partner who owned three restaurants and a small portfolio. After working together for one year, we had over fifty rental properties. Our mortgage, insurance + taxes were roughly $18,000 but we brought it $35,000 in revenue monthly. 

Well in January of 2023, he approached me and asked to buy me out completely. We agreed on a land contract for the next ten years where I would make $25,000 a month and then a final buyout of $4,000,000. So $7,000,000 in the end.

I did all this in eleven years, starting with $1200 and determination. Don't let anyone tell you, that you can't do something. Make a goal, work hard, and see it to the end. The American dream!

256,realestateinvesting,Sub 2,"I'm a newbie guys, why would a seller agree to a sub 2 transaction. Even if they incur a lot of selling costs, they get more money more quickly. If they have a problem with the property, they need the money now... no? I just don't get it. Sorry if this is stupid. Barely getting into the space."
257,realestateinvesting,Would you take a $1.5M loan in this scenario?,"* 1.5M loan
* 10 Years Term
* 5% APR
* Purpose: Buy a rental property that returns 8% annually

* Monthly Mortgage $16k (I'll get 10k from the rent, 6k self)

At the end of 10 years it'll come up to me paying $1.9M instead of the $1.5M that it is originally worth.

So I'm basically paying $415k out of pocket over the course of 10 years to be able to obtain this property that I can later sell or keep as an investment.

Current monthly income is 25k from other properties that I fully own, no other mortgages.

This property (any all my other properties) are 30+ unit properties that are fully rented by individual renters. So high vacancy rates/sudden vacancy probability is low.

If rent seems off its because it's not USD.

260,realestateinvesting,What to do with HELOC?,"I am getting ~$80k HELOC. My market is South Florida. I already own a property and I have a modest income so the HELOC caps out my capacity to take on more debt like a conventional mortgage. Obviously $100k isnt much in South Florida. I was planning on maybe using the $100k as 20% down for getting a DSCR or hard money loan under my LLC (no credit no income to show). 

Does anyone know how else I can get creative about financing a new property purchase.

-$100k HELOC
-DTI capped out
-LLC with no proof of income and infant credit

We are meeting next week to “talk numbers” and come up with a deal. Am I supposed to bring a half filled out contract supplied by my lawyer with me? Do I give earnest money to him? Can we just sign a napkin that says “i John smith will sell 123 Main Street for $215,000 to OP pending an official contract signed by both parties and their respective attorneys”? Or Do we just shake hands after verbally agreeing then my lawyer sends his lawyer the contract and I give earnest money to my lawyer then they give it to his lawyer?

I know to make the official offer contingent on attorney review, inspection, appraisal, financing etc (I know those contingencies may not fly in your market but he’s giving me first dibs) and I’m pretty solid on the numbers and cash flow but just need advice about what steps to follow leading to getting it under contract with no realtors.

265,realestateinvesting,Cost segregation study or SEP IRA?,"Cross posting this from personal finance. I know this sub will have a bias but want to hear all opinions! 

I am a self-employed 24 year old. Moved to the US a few years ago, have a green card. 

Stable income; last year $164,000, this year $175,000.

I save about 70% of my post tax income and invest aggressively.

I have a finance degree, am very disciplined, but never wanted to contribute to retirement accounts.

I always thought I’d leave the US within the next 5-10 years, and in the meantime I plan on buying a lot of real estate. 

So now I am debating between contributing ~$31,000 this year to SEP IRA to lower my taxes by about 27-28% for each dollar contributed and using this money as a down payment for a next multi family. I will then use cost segregation study and save at least as much in taxes next year without tying my money until I am 59 1/2.

The goal (ultimately) is not mere financial freedom but $10M+.

So I am debating between committing $31,000 to SEP and saving $8,700 in taxes this year, or using the $31,000 for a down payment on another $150,000 property and doing a cost segregation study, which will provide an $40,000-50,000 write off next year? 

The latter seems preferable to me, as I keep the flexibility for years to come. Can always take advantage of refinancing, 1031, etc. 

Hopefully I could hear from folks who have experience in cost segregation studies!

271,realestateinvesting,Slightly Upper Middle Class income person seeking Real Estate Investment Advice out of State,"Hello Reddit,



I live on the west coast and I was considering investing in real estate. My yearly salary is 130K, I also receive around 50-60K in RSUs, and an annual 10% bonus, so my ""actual"" income is around 190-200K. I have cash savings of 300K, and around 50K in a 401(k) account. 



The purpose of investing in real estate for me is to gain enough income to be able to purchase a house where I live, and to have passive income on the side. That is my goal when I decided to invest in real estate.




I initially was looking at listings near where I live (Los Angeles), and I do not think I can 1) afford to purchase them and 2) even if I did, the rent generated would not even cover the mortgage, let alone any repairs and maintenance. So I looked out of state. I picked Atlanta at random, and looking at property costs, it looks like there are houses/apartments for 150-300k, and rent seems to be around 800-1500. Doing some quick math, it looks like that is enough to cover the mortgage and a few hundred a month in profit. 



I wanted to ask if any experienced folks on reddit can please give me some guidance and tips on what I should try to do in my situation? Anything I should look out for? is investing out of state a smart idea or should I avoid it and try finding something closer that I can feasibly visit in a semi regular schedule? Other than basic things like age of the property and the area, what else should I consider when trying to buy property?



Any and all advice is appreciated, thank you!"

273,realestateinvesting,SEEKING ADVICE: I have $1.05M of equity in assets and cash-on-hand. How do I optimize this to start generating an absolute minimum of $7k in recurring monthly cashflow?,"I recently watched an interview clip from Kevin O'leary, where he was asked ""*if you were to lose all your wealth and be reduced to $1M of cash-on-hand, what would you do?*"" Without pause, he informed the interviewer he would use the $1M to invest in real estate, building an asset and cash flow base from which he could 'buy back his time,' enabling him to focus on other things like building new businesses.

I realized this means, with that $1M, Kevin O'leary is confident he could build enough cashflow through real estate to be exempt from hourly/salary employment. And I've since been asking myself the same question. Because $1M is where I am at today, and I am not in a position where I can be longterm comfortably unemployed with the cash flow I am generating on that nest egg.

So what does Kevin O'leary know about optimizing how that $1M would work for him through real estate, that I don't? I've come here to ask you all just that very thing.

The Facts

* **Goal:** How do I immediately leverage my cash on hand and equity in assets to increase monthly cashflow from $3,300 to an *absolute minimum* of $7,000+ per month.
* **Setting:** I own two multi family properties with 5 units total, representing a combined real estate value of $1.2M. Between the two properties, I have $550,000 of drawable equity that can be leveraged via a cash REFI, HELOC, etc. In addition to the $550,000 of drawable equity, I have $500,000 of cash-on-hand for a sum of $1.05M. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dH8p_N6Bw8RnT9WjKvSYgvnJQiGiBXxCVn-8fWxdI2s/edit?usp=sharing) is a spreadsheet with full property details.
* **About Me:** I typically make $200,000 in yearly salary, but was recently laid off - It's very likely I can re-establish this income within the next 3 months as I'm a very hireable technical skill. Or I can use my time towards DIY repairs on existing / new property purchases - I flipped houses as a kid with my father and am quite handy on most contracting work. Ultimately, I'd prefer to be making my money work for me so that I don't have to work, as I value my time more than my employment does and if I can get to $7k/mo with what I have I'd rather be ""self employed.""
* **Disclaimer:** This is not a humble brag post. This is the culmination of 10 years of hard work and saving, alongside some extreme risks that have put me inches from bankruptcy multiple times. I did not go to a big name university. I did not inherit anything. I am not smarter or better than anyone else.

Currently Evaluated Options

1. **Optimize Existing Properties** \- I estimate with $130,000 I could increase cashflow from the existing properties by $2,650 per month. Summed with the current property cashflow of $3,300 that puts me to $5,950. Or, $1,050 short of my minimum goal with still plenty of leverage to use for other investments. The risk being, aside from miscalculation, turning my triplex into a fourplex. I don't know how to do it or what hidden complications exist (I.E. sprinkler systems are required with 4 units or more) - so I'd probably get a permit for the update. But wouldn't inform the city of the change in unit count from 3 to 4. I'd just call it an ""in-law suite"" and slap another mailbox out front illegally.
2. **Purchase New Properties** \- I haven't thought this one through well enough yet, I've never had this much in savings. I would love ideas. So far I figure the optimum route with my intended goal would be to buy a distressed multi family for below market rate by using my current leverage for an outright purchase instead of a mortgage. In my area, another triplex sells for anywhere between $600,000 and above. So I figure maybe I can find one that needs a complete renovation for significantly less purchase cost. I could then DIY fix the units as affordably as possible for immediate equity. I could then refinance to consolidate and pay off my duplex which only has $80k left on the mortgage. That would increase cash-flow on my duplex by $560 per moth. Getting renters into the newly renovated property I just purchased would represent a potential additional $1,000 to $2,000 in monthly cashflow. Which combined with the increase on the duplex cash flow would put me above my goal of $7,000 in monthly cashflow. But this is where things get the most hairy for me logically. Are distressed properties the best option? If so and I proceed, what ratio of cash on hand versus debt should I leverage to purchase the property? Are there things I'm not thinking of like other types of debt outside of a cash REFI, HELOC, or an outright loan against my cash-on-hand to fund the purchase? Beyond typically expected expense variables in property purchasing, are there any risks I'm not thinking of? I.E. I just learned about holding costs as part of the equation for modeling purchasing distressed properties.

To restate the ask, **how do I optimize what I have to immediately start generating a minimum of $7k/mo in cashflow**. Preferably, if anyone has started from scratch like me and has done some fancy maneuvers at this phase to 'level up' - I'd love for you to DM me and provide some sage advise. I worked to hard to make this big of a next move without being absolutely confident I'm doing the right thing."
274,realestateinvesting,College student rentals,"Good afternoon, I wanted to hear some opinions on something.

The question comes from the property without income.My business partner and I purchased it in 2015. The property is not inhabitable and requires a total remodel. We have been doing improvements to it over the years, paying taxes and utilities, etc since purchase, but haven’t taken any deductions from our taxes. My previous accountant said that all the expenses incurred would be considered capital improvements to the property once the property comes online and begins to generate rental income.

302,realestateinvesting,"Need advice, rent vs sell property","I would like some guidance on whether to sell or rent out my property. Some background: I am moving to California to be near a family member requiring some assistance after a sudden health issue. I currently live in Florida in a townhouse I bought back in 2021. At the time, I thought I would be staying in the area for at least another 3-5 years but life happens.

Some numbers: Purchase price 298k with 3-4% down purchased in Fall 2021. Total cash to close around $16,000. Interest rate 3.45%. My escrow significantly increased this year which is of no surprise as my property taxes increased by almost $700 and my homeowner's insurance increased by $1000. I am also paying PMI which is about $230 a month. My total mortgage+escrow+PMI payment is $2100 now (previously $1800 when I bought in 2021). My HOA dues have also increased to about $325 monthly. In total my monthly expenses for the home, excluding utilities/maintenance, is about $2,425. I hope to be able to reappraise the property in Fall 2023 to see if the PMI can be dropped. 

I plan on moving out around May/June and I am unsure if it would be smarter to sell the property vs renting it. I am a first generation and first time homeowner so I appreciate any guidance. There are some townhomes in the community sitting around 340-350k and have been on the market for a few months now. Rental prices in the community appear to vary between $2500-$2700 and get rented out fairly quickly. My townhome certainly has some upgrades in comparison. I would be utilizing a property manager if I were to rent which would take 50% of the first months rent and 11.9% thereafter. My two main concerns with renting is if I will even be able to breakeven to cover my expenses on the property and how this rental income will affect my taxable income. My fear with selling the property is that it may sit on the market for a few months and I am not sure if I would end up losing money after closing costs etc.

Again, I am new to home ownership and renting out properties so I appreciate any guidance! I will be meeting with a financial counselor, real estate agent, and accountant next week as well."

314,realestateinvesting,Deciding on purchasing first home,"Hi,

I am a 23 male that is married to his wife 24 with a 6 month old child. I recently moved to maryland to join the federal government as a GS5. I will eventually make it to a gs9 in 3 years. I get a yearly pay raise based off the GS pay scale. The houses up in maryland here for a typical single family home go for 300k-350k due to inflation. Similar homes in 2019 went for 250k before inflation.

We currently live in a tiny 1bed/1bath apartment. I have 16k saved up for a down payment but I am concerned that I should wait longer to purchase a house due to how the market looks. I will have to use a first time homebuyer loan for our first house purchase. My credit score is 750 and my wife has a 720. 

I do not plan on leaving Maryland because there is so much job opportunity to advance my government career here. However I am going to start applying for higher Government jobs in august of 2024. 

With all that information in mind, would staying in an apartment for a couple of years more be better, or should I continue to commit to a house? Keep in mind the economics of the market."

321,realestateinvesting,Getting To The Next Level: How to Scale From 20 Self-Managed Doors to 200?,"I currently have several buildings, for a total of 20 rental doors, along with my full time job. I self-manage these, and have automated as much as possible, such as automated rent deposits, mortgage/tax/insurance payments, etc. 

Much of it is on automatic, but I do have to deal with tenant calls at times, as well as I have a worker and myself where we usually go 1 day on the weekends and either do cleaning, maintenance, repairs, or when an apartment turns over, the worker and sometimes other workers are turning the apt over while I also either run to/from the big box stores for supplies/materials, or I also take part in the work.

To me, this is the most I can comfortably handle. I don’t think I can take on another building and self-manage, but I do want to keep growing.

For those with more apartment doors, how did you grow past the around-20 door level?  I realize getting a property manager may be an option, but am weary of the quality of what I’ve seen, and given there’d be mortgages/interest expense, I don’t think I can justify what they do for what they cost (~10% rent?)

My goal is to acquire properties for longterm cash flow, not fix/flip or capital appreciation."
322,realestateinvesting,Advice On Next Steps,"
Hey there! I'm looking for some advice on a situation I'm pursuing.

Looking at purchasing a piece of land in WA state via a private sale. Looking to be around 200k and I'm using my HELOC funds to pay for the process. The land's Zestimate/Redfin estimate show it to be worth around 275k to 325k (which I know isn't always accurate).

The reason I'm going private is because the land possesses a 1971 manufactured home, along with an ~800 sqft shop that was built for a few bedrooms. Due to the manufactured being built prior to '76, I'm unable to pursue brokerage financing (and it's a pain in the ass to sell, hence why I'd be getting it a bit cheaper, along with knowing the seller). 

Now for the question--I initially planned on renovating the mobile and renting it, along with the shop, out. However, I realized that if I'm ever in a pickle, I'll be in the same boat as the current seller, not being able to get the best value out of the property. Do I demo the manufactured and put a new 130k double wide on? Do I demo it and convert the shop into a residence? Is there a way to remodel the manufactured/convert it into a newer stick built?

Thank you so much, and I'm sorry for the long post."

330,realestateinvesting,Cash for Keys,"I have a duplex which is currently pending sale. One side is occupied by a tenant who signed a one year lease in August and the other is vacant (for the new FHA buyer). The occupied side tenant had a clean record up until February. They claimed they had a new job and asked for an extension to pay rent. They were being compliant with the sale (showing for the inspection and appraisal with no issues), so I was instructing my property manager to be extra nice with this tenant. I did not want this to blow up the sale, and their record was perfect for the first 6 months so I instructed them to take it easy with them.

Of course here we are on March 3rd, multiple extensions later (incl the tenant calling the PM yesterday to say they would pay today, which they obviously did not), and they not only have not paid February but March either. The house is scheduled to close on Friday the 17th but can be pushed back a week. I was thinking of offering the tenant to forgive their rent and give half their deposit back if they are out 2 days before the scheduled closing and the place isn't a sty. PM is out until Monday, so I have the weekend to think about it.

I’ve read so many stories of fraud, and people being duped re wires.

Typically a phishing scam. They are in escrow and they get an email saying to wire to X bank.  And the email is fake, the money is wired to Nigeria etc.

My questions:

1. I already paid wired the deposit a few weeks ago. If I wire the rest of the money to the EXACT SAME ACCOUNT that has to be 100% safe, right?

2. I’d of course call and confirm the account info with the escrow officer I’ve been dealing with. That also seems to be close to 100% (although I suppose I could speak to him on the day he decided to go rogue and booked a flight to Tahiti).

I’m guessing these days 99% of this is done by wire. I could get a cashiers check but that requires multiple transfers to a brick and mortar bank, wait times, etc. Very unwieldy."

We paid 239k for it in Fall of 2020 with 20% down on a 30 year fixed 3% interest rate. We have also put a lot of sweat-equity into it, as although at the time it had all new mechanicals like a roof, HVAC, etc. it was outdated inside so we got a good price. It’s now worth ~315k. Very confident based on comps that we can safely charge $2,000 a month in rent for it with the PITI being a tick under $1,400. It’s also in an A neighborhood. 

We already got pre-approved up to 400k with 10% down for a new primary residence, but with interest rates so high I’m not sure I want to pay PMI on top of a 6-7+% 30-year interest rate. I was told a 3/1 ARM by a local credit union is at 5.2% interest with $420 in total closing costs and we can refinance to a fixed mortgage in negotiated in good faith once rates hopefully subside.

Help needed please!,"I have a 1 bed/1 bath condo on the outskirts of SW Denver that I’ve owned and used as a rental for the last few years. It rents for $1,000-1,100 (currently $1,100), and my total payments are about $700, so it currently cash flows about $400/month, not accounting for repairs, vacancy, etc. However, there was a sewer back up 2 years ago that ruined the flooring, bathroom, drywall, etc. Insurance claim provided all the necessary repairs, but it was a nightmare and caused my solid, long-term tenant to move out. I’ve since gotten another good tenant, but she’s now moving out too because of various issues. The most recent being 2 shootings that took place in the parking lot, as well as some mailboxes getting broken into. About once or twice a year, the kitchen sink and floor drain back up because the main drain line that all the units tie into gets clogged with grease and food from other units (mine is a ground level unit so all the upper units connect to the drain line from above). The HOA eventually gets it hydro jetted and resolved, but not until after days of sitting water and more water damage (although mostly minimal compared to the sewer back up). My tenant will be out by the first of April, right when the spring market picks up. There are 2 recent comps with identical floor plans that sold for $185k and $190k, which is pretty good and close to the height of their value from last year (highest sale peaked at about $200k). I owe $85k on it, it probably needs $5-10k in updating to get top dollar (new appliances, new countertops, and cabinets in the kitchen). I’m debating whether I should sell it, or continue to keep it as a rental. I don’t necessarily need the money from the sale, but it would help me get a new car for cash, update my current owner-occupied house, and have some left over to invest or save ($20-30k ish left over most likely). My goal is amass rental properties over the years, but I’m not sure if this one is worth the headache. I’m also wondering if I’ll be better off long term with the money from the proceeds by selling it now, or making smaller annual returns (4k ish per year).

I have a few tax questions that I can't find real answers to online.

* We plan on putting properties under an LLC owned by the C Corp. Are profits made by the C Corp that are used to purchase property through the LLC still subject to the 21% flat tax? For example: If we have $100,000 profit that we use as a down payment, will we still owe $21,000 in taxes on that profit, or is it sheltered because it was used in the acquisition of an asset.
* Is cashflow in an LLC owned by a C Corp that is re-invested into the note of the property subject to taxation? 100% of cashflow we plan on putting back into the properties to pay them off quicker.

BTW I do have a six-month emergency fund, and we are both getting our 401k matches in our jobs, but not investing beyond that to pay for our wedding. I also don't plan on us increasing our contributions till after her student loans are paid off. 

She has about $55k in student loans, and our house (3 bed 1 bath with 1,000 Sq ft, and a finished basement) is in my name with $123k left on the mortgage.
I believe with our savings (excluding bonuses, and tax returns) we can be completely debt free within 4 years assuming no big expenses come up. 

My current plan is to pay off the student loans first, and then the house. Once the house is paid off I would like to turn that into my first rental property, and then move on to our second home, and repeat the process. 

I've been researching comparable houses currently being rented in our city, and surrounding area, and the average rent is about $1,300/month. If I have ran the numbers on the house correctly I'm estimating a cash flow of $769-$860/month depending on if I actively manage it or hire a property management company. 

Ideally I would like our cash flow from our rentals to replace our income from our day jobs so we have more time to do what we want with our lives. I am aware that rental properties inherently require work, and attention, and rentals would eat up even more free time while we're working our jobs, but having any more free time after we no longer have to work a W2 in the future is better than nothing.

My current plan is to buy a house, pay it off, rinse and repeat. This would obviously take more time, and would lead to a smaller portfolio overall, but I believe each property would bring in more cash flow.

If you were in my shoes what would you do? Would you take the time to pay off the house for a greater rate of cash flow, or simply rent it out with a mortgage, and have more properties with less cash flow?
  
Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated."

358,realestateinvesting,Mortgage payment went up $200/monthly,"Bought a house in Feb 2022 for $115K. The city reassessed it from $65K to $90K. This was when the housing market was hot but interest rates were extremely low. The market value is $103K now. However, the city did total reassessment of every house and raised me again (within a year) from $90K to $120K. $55K increase within a year. Now my mortgage payment has gone up $200/month. I submitted an appeal and gave them 4 almost identical houses within a 200 yard radius that only got bumped to $100K. These houses sold when the market wasn’t as hot. I understand I bought the house for $115K but I knew at the time I was paying over the actual market value. Any advice on how I could fight this? 

Important to note: all public information and the city stated “they are not receiving more tax revenue, but rather redistributing it.” You can easily look thru the list and see the old vs new reassessment and none of the houses went down. There was one that stayed the same and the market value for it is actually $45K under what all of the realtor sites estimate. If you haven’t guessed it, it’s the city assessor.

I am self employed and my dad who lives with me is retired on social security. Does anyone know if I can dispute this or if there are any exemptions that we dont know about?

Who should I call? The mortgage lender or the assessors office again?"
369,realestateinvesting,Under Market Rent on Newly Purchased Property,"So I purchased a new property with 2 units vacant in a great family-friendly neighborhood of a city in NE, one of which I occupied, and the other unit rented out within 20 days of purchase.

Unit-1: 2B/1B: 1200 (Section-8 tenant moved in 2016, market rent is 1600)

Unit-2: 2B/1B: Owner occupied

Unit-3: 1B/1B: 900 (Section-8 tenant moved in 2008)

Unit-4: 1B/1B: 1400(Newly rented, section-8 tenant)

&amp;#x200B;

I might be able to increase the rent by, say 200$ for 2B, and 150$ for 1B tenants, but that's about it. Their leases end in June'23. 

What would you do? Ideally, raise it to market rent by giving them a notice 2 months ahead or not renewing the lease if not accepting the increase, given I live in the building, it might be a weird encounter."

374,realestateinvesting,Just informed my new tenants that I will be terminating their lease,"We are closing on a duplex in early April. Both sides need significant work inside and out. Our plan is to terminate the current leases at the start of May and rehab.

I spoke to the current property managers a couple days ago and asked if i could reach out to the tenants to introduce myself and let them know our plans. They agreed and said they would reach out too. The current property managers dont have a lease on file, security deposit, couldn't tell me how utilities are paid, etc. All of this i found out after the sale progressed. Turns out they havent told the tenants anything either. One side barely knew the place was for sale.

I went by in person with a written notice for the change of ownership and intent to terminate in May. One side took it well. It was actually the side i expected issues from. The side i thought would be ok, took it hard. This was my first time doing something like this. I expected an emotional response but it was definitely interesting actually doing it in person. We'll have to see how things go i guess. 

How was everyone else's first experience giving hard news?"
375,realestateinvesting,"HOA changed rules RE: rentals, what are my options?","I’ve got a condo that’s a rental. It’s currently rented. The HOA recently amended their rules to not allow condo rentals without several years of ownership time, which I don’t have yet. It’s likely my tenant will stay and this won’t be an issue, but if it is, is there anything I can do other than keep the place empty, move into it myself, or sell it? There’s a clause about being grandfathered into the new rules, but it would only apply until the lease is up, meaning there’s a potential gap where I’d have the property unleased until I hit the ownership time requirement."
376,realestateinvesting,How to deal with sheds on a rental property?,"I have an SFH rental property that sits on over half an acre, and has a 350 foot building on a far side of the backyard that has roof/windows/electrical but no plumbing or HVAC. For the previous tenants, I had that part of the yard fenced off and designated as separate from the SFH rental (e.g. the tenants did not have access to the portion of the yard with the shed on it). 

I have a tenant turnover and a prospective tenant is asking to use the building. My sense is that one should not give access to tenants to a building that is not habitable. Even if they said they just wanted to use it for storage, the variable temperatures would be a risk to anything they stored there. And then you wouldn't want someone trying to live in or have family live in an unhabitable building.

So, what to other landlords do with sheds? It seems like sheds of varying degrees of developedness must be a relatively common feature in SFHs."

I’ve already owned a small primary home and am looking to invest my first small project if the project is right, which I know is rare these days. 

Recently I found this charming old property out of the state that’s priced quite below the market in a very good location. The owner has owned and cared for it for many years. It definitely needs a facelift but also has a lot of potentials. It’s within my small and cautious budget, and math for cash flow makes sense too. I was perplexed by the below market price though until I noticed the flooding risk factor of this house is rated 8/10 in 30 years. It says the flooding risk in 1 year is 16%, but will jump to 86% in 5 years and above 98% in 10 years. Obviously this won’t work with BRRRR since I don’t wanna deal with a potentially flooding property as a small out-of-state landlord, but what about flipping? If the flipping can be done within a year, will it make a profit? The listing price is quite below the market. Or this sort of property is doomed in general? How accurate is Risk Factor report?"

382,realestateinvesting,Selling and repurchasing the same investment property in TX?,"I'm in an uncommon scenario. We have a decent amount of unsecured debt we've unfortunately racked up over 2 international moves and 1 spouse taking 4 years off to care for 2 of our 3 children who were both younger than school age up until August of 2022. We do however own an investment property with an approximate value of $250K and a remaining mortgage balance of about $78K. We'd rather convert our debt into a new mortgage but obtaining a refinance on an investment property has proved extremely difficult, and HELOCs on investment properties are not permitted in Texas. In addition, our heavy debt load at the moment means our credit score is in the 660 range despite having impeccable payment history. 

Further complicating matters is that we have an older, single, disabled tenant so we are not inclined to just divest ourselves of the property which would obviously be the simplest option. She is getting an extremely charitable deal from us on the rent and would likely be in a very bad spot were we to sell. 

Today I had the novel thought of potentially selling the house to a very trusted family member with an agreement to maintain our tenant's lease, using the proceeds to pay off our unsecured debt, and then rebuying the property. We'd probably pay the closing costs, etc. This would allow us to get a better interest rate than a refinance while still achieving the same aim. My only concern is it seems a bit ""fraudy"" from a mortgage perspective, but then again, I usually have only bought primary residences and if the purchaser is never intending to live there, maybe not? The only other consideration I can think of is capital gains for the purchaser but the cost basis and new purchase price should be basically identical.

Before I bother pursuing the deal just wondered if anybody here could let me know if this is a stupid idea, borderline fraud, borderline illegal, etc. or if I've devised an ingenious way to solve my family's financial issue while keeping our very kind tenant in her home? I wouldn't want to go forward if concealing any aspect of it from anybody would even be a thought. Thanks!"

I have two options at hand:

Option A: I can opt for down payment assistance, which would mean I won't have to put any money down for the property due to its location.

Option B: Alternatively, I can choose to use a hard money lender to put down the 3.5% down payment using an FHA 203K loan. This way, I can renovate the property, refinance, and then pay off the hard money lender.

One idea that I've had is to by a single family home that's more space than I actually need, such as a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom home, and then convert part of it to an Airbnb space.

In my mind, this would look like taking one of the bedrooms and baths, adding an exterior door, and permanently blocking the interior door to the rest of the home. I'd then add a kitchenette and advertise it on Airbnb as a studio in-law suite. It seems relatively low effort, and easily reversible if I decide that I don't want to Airbnb anymore, or want to reclaim the space myself.

What I don't know is if there are commonly any zoning laws or other things that would prevent me from just buying a home and doing this.

406,realestateinvesting,House Hacking in major cities 2023,"My wife and I are trying to get started in real estate investing by way of house hacking. We are in the Houston, Tx area. For the past several months I have been constantly analyzing duplexes around town. The common theme is the prices at the current interest rates do not leave room for profitability. Often even calculating using offer prices 10%+ below ask results in the same. 

Projected rental income while residing in one unit is not covering 50% of expenses. Doubling that rental income when projecting move out and renting both units then of course projects negative cash flow. 

The very best deals i’ve scouted (few and far between) look something like break even or positive cash flow in the $50-$100/mo range. Cash on cash returns in the neighborhood of 1-3%. I didn’t expect to quit my day job off one duplex but the capital we would be investing for returns like that obviously don’t make sense. I know real estate investing is what I want to do so I refuse to get discouraged but is house hacking viable in major cities right now? 

Or perhaps am I looking at things wrong. How much of the monthly expenses should I expect rental income to cover while residing in the other unit to be considered a good deal? Is it possible for it to be sub 50% and have any hope of meaningful positive cash on cash return when renting both units out a year or so later?

My brother in law passed away unexpectedly on Monday, and didn’t have medical benefits or life insurance and had quite a bit of debt. 

I’m working through the legal process/debt management with my sister to see what can be mitigated, but sadly it looks likely that her home will need to be sold to pay her husband’s debts. 

She has an 8 year old foster daughter who was homeless before joining the family and has a lot of anxiety issues about home security as a result. Because of this I’m trying to get creative with how I can help them keep their home. 

I’m considering attempting to buy their home from my sister then renting it back to her so she can still live there with her daughter. 

Based on my research, it appears there could be some tax advantages to purchasing the home through an LLC that I set up (I am also setting up a call with my CPA to confirm). I will be renting the property at a loss to help my sister get back on her feet, so want to do what I can to mitigate the loss I’ll be taking on this. 

That being said, I’ve never sought financing through an LLC, so I’m not sure what to expect. I have the down payment necessary, but don’t have an LLC with established credit at this point. 

Would you suggest setting up an LLC in this case? Are there tax advantages to doing so, or would the benefit purely be to protect my personal assets? Would I even be able to qualify for a loan through the llc if I don’t already have one with established credit? Thanks for your help!"

Need ideas for how best to structure a deal that requires $10+ million in private funding for land purchase + construction,"A family member has a few connected lots in a very desirable and unique location that currently has both commercial and residential properties that cash flow $160k/yr. All lots were rezoned for mixed use making it even more attractive. They’re considering doing a land lease with a development company but would entertain selling it to me, however the land value is $5-7 million. They were approached to either purchase or lease the property and build 20 apartments + 2-4 retail spaces on the ground level that they proposed would cost $9m but who knows.

I’ve dabbled in real estate and construction , but not at this level, however have a friend in commercial development who would help put a team together as well as estimate the project. I’m looking for ideas around how to go about finding private money to put up for both the purchase of the property as well as for construction. I have connections with high net worth individuals who may have interest, but unsure about how to structure the deal beyond the loan for purchase. I wouldn’t be interested to give up equity  but of course want to establish a pay schedule and/or payback + interest in a redo event. My family member will want to get their money out of it which would leave little room to refi and pay the lender back with interest after the property purchase . Loose projections based on a low cap rate, it’s been estimated that a completed project of this type and in this location would increase the value to $20-$30 million and would not be difficult to secure long term leases based on local demand. We very conservatively estimate that this would gross $80k/mo with 100% occupancy.

I’m looking for ideas to best approach structuring this deal using private investment. I understand I would need to build a pro forma first and likely contact an engineer/architect to draft up plans so that we can get a better idea for construction costs.

435,realestateinvesting,Getting additional info on property without establishing agent relationship,"Can I contact the listing agent to get disclosures without establishing an agent-buyer relationship with them?

I'm looking at a few different regions for a property, and the chance of me buying in any one region is probably only 30%.  So I don't think I'm ready to pull the trigger just yet, unless after reading through the disclosures, it makes sense for me, and then at that point my finger is half way pulled.  

At that point, I'd consider getting an agent different from the listing agent (though I know some folks here suggest going with the listing so that there may be a little more negotiating room as maybe the LA might reduce their commission from the seller).

Is going straight to the LA for disclosures now the right approach for me?"

444,realestateinvesting,Is a HELOC the best option to finish our live-in flip?,"My spouse and I are live-in house flippers who have previously used cash from our W2 jobs to cover rehab costs. 

Unfortunately, we need to sell our current property this summer. It's worth about $1.1m as-is, but with $150k more work, it will sell at $1.5-$1.7. 

Our financial situation: 

* We currently owe $525k on this property. 
* We have about $90k in cash but need it for moving costs, down pymt, earnest money, etc.
* My spouse has a solid, high-income W2 job, but I quit mine a year ago to take care of my son after he was diagnosed with a chronic illness. 
* We have two other properties, both rentals. We have about 50% equity in each (and one of them would be worth $75k more with only $10k work), but they only break even monthly and we try to claim a loss every year for tax purposes. 
* Our plan is to pay off the HELOC as soon as we sell and buy/rehab the next live-in flip all cash with the leftover equity so that we have no mortgage on our homestead. That way, we can pay down the other two rental property mortgages faster to unlock the monthly income.
* We otherwise have no car, school, or credit card debts.

I feel like we're a safe bet for lenders given our equity position and plans, but we haven't pursued a HELOC before. So my questions are:

* Is a HELOC a realistic option?
* If so, what kinds of numbers do I need to pull to talk to lenders? Is it as complex as getting a mortgage? We haven't filed our 2022 taxes yet, so I don't have that, just our returns from '20/'21.

I've talked to SoFi and they've soft quoted me 10% (prime + ~3%). Can anyone recommend me some lenders that would work with me that have great rates? Thanks in advance!

Some specifics for those that want to consider how risky my decision would be:

I have excellent credit (800+). My home value today is ~$1.5M based on Zillow &amp; Redfin, current principle remaining on 1st mortgage is $890K at 2.375% and is a VA Loan.

461,realestateinvesting,The problem with home-flipping giants,"In January, when Ticketmaster started selling tickets to Taylor Swift's upcoming Eras Tour, millions of would-be concertgoers were devastated to find out that tickets sold out in a presale open only to fans with special access codes.

Disappointed Swifties had to resort to the secondhand market, where general admission for the cheapest seats, officially priced at a reasonable $49 and up, were being hawked for $243 and up on Stubhub. (At least one person splashed out $5,500 for floor seats.)

The scalpers, people or entities who resell something quickly for profit, are winning. Meanwhile, the corporate scalpers of the housing market — companies that buy and relist homes by the thousands without doing much, if any, work on them to make a profit — are struggling.

As the housing market sputters and stalls, it's becoming harder for these companies to make a profit. Their losses highlight how, when the cost to borrow money is high, firms that don't add much value get hit hard. Last week, two of the biggest remaining corporate home-flipping companies, Opendoor and Offerpad, reported dismal earnings, another sign that their business model is incredibly risky.


Opendoor, a $900 million public company based in San Francisco, and Offerpad, a $143 million public company based near Phoenix, Arizona, promised investors they could make most of their money by essentially scalping, or flipping, homes. 

These firms — as well as now-defunct arms of Zillow and Redfin — dubbed themselves instant buyers, or iBuyers, because they claimed homeowners could sell their properties to them quickly and easily, without the stress of hiring a real-estate agent to list their places on the open market. 

But unlike individual home flippers, who typically target derelict or outdated properties and perform extensive cosmetic and mechanical improvements to a home before relisting it for sale, iBuyers were noted for selling properties just weeks after closing on them. The companies even acknowledge that they make minimal improvements to properties over just a few weeks before relisting them. It's a volume game — and iBuyers have spent billions on tens of thousands of homes in hot pandemic housing markets like Phoenix, Las Vegas, Atlanta, Tampa, and elsewhere.

A spokesperson for Opendoor confirmed to Insider that the company typically only performs necessary repairs to make the property ""clean and safe,"" as opposed to an extensive rehab that a smaller-scale flipper might conduct. And a spokesperson for Offerpad told Insider that the company seeks to buy, renovate, and sell each property in less than 100 days.

More here:

https://www.businessinsider.com/home-flipping-companies-opendoor-offerpad-ibuyers-earnings-losses-housing-market-2023-2

It's amazing that these companies aren't bankrupt already. Opendoor alone has burned $2 billion since Zillow exited the business. Are we still convinced they ""make money on the fees""?

Do we think this model will still exist in a couple years or are these companies toast?"

469,realestateinvesting,So you want to be a landlord- a comprehensive list of the little things you need to know and things that will definitely happen to you.,"This is not about financing or evaluating your first deal. This is about things you can look forward to over the next few years. The little things.  Feel free to add your own. 

1) You cannot own a caulk gun. You must own at least 4. And when you need one next week you will buy a fifth because the first 4 are lost.  You actually own 8 but they have never all been in the same room so you can’t be sure. You can only be sure that if you do find one it will be the really cheap one that is frustrating to use and doesn’t have a built in cutter. And you cannot find a razor to cut the tube, despite owning 20 of those. 

2) You want to turn your property over to a good manager. But there are no good property managers. You kinda suck at managing your own properties and you are still better than most companies. Yet You do the math at least 7 times a year…and it just isn’t worth it. Then a month later you get tired of the calls and do the math again, just to be sure. 

3) If you play the game long enough you will lose some hope in humanity. The conditions they choose to live in and eventually inflict on you are staggering. The lies are sometimes obvious and maddening. And the truth is often worse. 

4) that first flooring you laid with great pride will look like kindergarten work after your 10th round laying flooring. 

5) I’m sorry your cat died, Denise.  But the pet funeral and memorial back tattoo do not take priority over paying rent. 

6) you feel like a genius when you have a month or two of problem free rent collection. 

7) you feel like a sucker when 6 out of 7 water heaters go out in one 3 month hellish bonanza of flooding and pain. 

8) you will absolutely throw a few personal items in the cart at Lowe’s and write them off.  I really don’t need a new shower curtain at the rental. But I am trying out the brand at home and considering starting to provide them. 

9) your YouTube algorithm will be filled with tile tips, electrician porn and a couple of Hispanic dudes throwing up drywall at 4 sheets per minute. 

10) any plumbing job is a 3 lowes minimum. Tighten a leaky p trap?  3 trips somehow. 

11) your tenants have nicer cars than you.  My tenants collectively own 56 cars. Mine would be ranked # 51 on the list. 

12). it is hard to avoid shiny object syndrome. You will consider cross collateralizing into a commercial loan then syndicating into a 500 unit apartment. Or maybe note investing. Or a short term cabin on the lake. Or buying single family houses in Detroit for $1200 at tax sales and making 100% monthly return. Or auctions. You need to go to auctions.  

13) your driving routes can be influenced by your units. Initially it seems like a good plan to drive by regularly. Eventually you add 3 miles to the commute to avoid knowing what they are doing to your once glorious yard. 

14) small drips are a big deal. 

15) there are tenants that do not even own a screwdriver to tighten a drawer pull knob. You wonder how they function.  

16) if you rent to college girls you automatically house an almost equal number of boys. They do not pay rent. Or clean. They do not leave. They are hobosexuals. 

17) You will forget what you paid for a house. It kinda stops mattering. 

18) some guy at their desk at Amazon in Seattle will tell you being a landlord is not retirement through a Reddit forum. You will agree after you finish your zip line tour in the actual Amazon."

Due to water damage, we have to repair a good chunk of our hardwood floor. We are considering either partial repair and the sanding/refinishing so it matches the original hardwood floor. This would also keep it consistent with the hardwood flooring on the stairs/banisters. Or replacing the entire continuous flooring on the first floor with LVP. The cost is about the same, with the partial repair and sanding/refinishing just a few hundred bucks more.

What would you do? Because the current game plan is to rent, we're thinking about LVP for durability and practicality. But it seems like we'd lose out on the value of our hardwood floors, especially since this was what we originally had prior to the damage and the cost is about the same.

472,realestateinvesting,How are you handling the bullwhip effect on rents?,"Asking from the perspective of the tenant. I have a pre-Covid lease (renewed annually, of course) and I am below market currently, but I also see rental prices beginning to normalize. I feel like both me and my landlord kind of saw what's happening in the market, and kind of continued course as-is. My last 2 annual increases were slightly more than past increases, but not too too much more. All things considered, I think it's been a fair trade: they keep getting a tenant paying with more-than-multi-year 100% on-time payment history, they still move closer to market rate, but the slight discount benefits both parties in that we're both getting reliability from one another, despite a shifting macroeconomic environment."

Property is around $200k. Currently the max rent potential is around $2,300 a month. Id likely do 10% down, given that I have limited options based on my cash on hand.

A few questions:
1. If you take into account taxes (high in this area), capital expenditure, utilities, vacancies etc. cash flow is around $150-200/mo - does that seem too low to be worth it?
2. My major concern is coming out of pocket and draining my cash reserves. I can get potentially 10% down (without PMI), or I can shoot for FHA m3.5% down (with PMI) and be cash flow negative for a period
3. How do you calculate cash on cash return or cap rate when you have to account for 1 year of vacancy because of the residency requirement (have to be primary residence for the first year for the mortgage)

I have loads more questions but just looking for a sounding board for anyone willing to entertain me.

To add, I think the area has appreciation potential, but I'm not hanging my hat on that. Just trying to get one under my belt to learn the ropes before I'm too old to take a risk.

As the title says, the moving company damaged some flooring when my tenant moved in. I hired the contractor for the repair because that seemed to be the best way to ensure things are repaired to my standards, and using the same material.

Turns out, the flooring manufacturing company discontinued the parts that were damaged, and replaced it with a similar, but different fitting part. Because of this, the contractor installed the new part incorrectly and it now needs to be redone (increased repair cost because additional material/labor hours are needed).

No one has paid anyone yet. Logically, the moving company pays the tenant, the tenant pays me, and I pay the contractor. But now that the contractor has also messed up, what happens?.. Should the increased cost go to the moving company as this is their fault to begin with? Estimate initially given to the movers was about $550, it will now be about $850."

491,realestateinvesting,"People who ""never invest for appreciation"", how long have you been in the market? What is the value of your portfolio?","I understand the dangers of investing solely for appreciation. Particularly if you buy a property that'll run you deep in the red for years, but there seems to be a sizeable chunk of people here that believe investing for appreciation at all is tantamount to gambling.

And it can be. In the short term. Hoping to retire on appreciation in 5 years is risky. Banking on your property values going up in the next year to cover your balloon loan in the next year is *dangerous*. We can mostly agree on that, right?  


But I feel like most of us have another 20-30 years ahead of us before we retire. Perhaps another 40-60 years before we pass. Surely over these sorts of time frames appreciation is, if not guaranteed, then a pretty safe bet, no?  


Why are people so against investing for appreciation if you're in for the long-haul? Quite frankly, isn't appreciation the reason we're here? If you bought a property for $1 million and managed to get, say, 1.5% of its value in monthly rent ($15k/month), paid all cash (no mortgage), and 40% of the income went to maintaining and running the unit (with taxes), you're left with $108k (9k/month\*12months) in net income.  
Is all the risk and headaches worth it when you can, at least historically, have gotten a similar gain from dumping that million into the S&amp;P500 and coming back to it in 30 years? And finding such a deal would be...hard, to say the least. At least not one saddled with other issues (vacancies, turnovers, crime, etc.)  


Being able to borrow 60-80% of the value of the property and take in 100% of the appreciation the main reason real estate comes ahead, no? Depends on the market, of course, but even LCOL places usually enjoy some appreciation, too.   


I have some ideas on why people completely avoid appreciation, but I would like to hear some answers before I toss in my 2 cents.

That is only landscaping, sewer, mortgage, insurance and taxes, so it is appealing to increase rent to be able to save more towards future expenses as the water heaters are old, the roofs will need replaced in the coming years, etc. but I want to do this in good conscience.

WWYD?  On one hand it seems obvious to raise the rent if I think of it as being $700 under market, but on the other hand I realize her place isn't the same as the comps and I value her being an easy/good tenant. And I know there are people who would say raise it by the max each year until they move.  I'm not sure I could do that TBH.  There has to be a happy medium between having a good tenant at a certain amount under market, but also not being a charity.

So, landlords of Reddit, what would be your 'happy medium' number for this tenant?

If she doesn't decide to renew the lease I will renovate and based on how the last unit went months ago, should be able to find well qualified and seemingly stable/good tenants at $1600 again after renovations.

Help me think straight."

497,realestateinvesting,How strict is minimum lot area for zoning?,"I have an offer in on a duplex that sits on a 70x128 foot lot. The current duplex (4b. 2ba.) sits on the far right side of the lot, with 45ish feet on the left as just flat open land. I have been doing extensive research the past few days on if I can build an additional 2 units in the open space to technical make it a 4-unit building. It sits in a neighborhood where all the houses are no more than 15 feet apart and right now just looks like an empty lot when you look at it from Birds Eye view. It’s too small to be divided and sold as its own lot (minimum 40 ft width per lot), but based on the zoning, it’s too small to be a cluster development.

The question is, how strict are cities on the minimum lot area for zoning? The minimum width for a lot to house a 4-unit building is 50 ft, so it passes in that department. However, the lot is 8,960 s.f. and the minimum lot area for a 4-unit is 9,000 s.f. The lot is 0.044% too small. Is the line ridged?

The ability to potentially build on already cash flowing land is a huge opportunity in my eyes even if there is some risk the city might not allow it."

506,realestateinvesting,Breaking: FHA MIP reduction will help buyers looking for 3-4 unit properties,"FHA has made it harder to purchase a 3-4 unit home in recent years. These properties need to pass the ""self-sufficiency test"", meaning the net market rents must meet or exceed the payment.

Starting March 20, 2023, FHA is reducing its monthly mortgage insurance (MIP) by 0.30%, or $100 per month for a $400k mortgage.

It's not a big change, but more 3-4 unit properties will be eligible simply because the payment will be lower.

For example:

|Home Details|Old FHA MIP|New FHA MIP|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Purchase price|$550,000|$550,000|
|P&amp;I payment + taxes etc|$3,713|$3,713|
|**Monthly MIP**|**$383**|**$248**|
|Total payment|$4,095|$3,961|
|Net projected rent|$4,000|$4,000|
|Passes self-sufficiency?|No (rent &lt; payment)|Yes (rent &gt; payment)|

If you were close to passing self-sufficiency in 2022 or early 2023, you might want to start looking for another 3 or 4 unit property. 

More about this change at [https://thisismortgage.com/reduced-fha-mip-to-help-3-and-4-unit-property-buyers/](https://thisismortgage.com/reduced-fha-mip-to-help-3-and-4-unit-property-buyers/)

One was at an asking price with 3% on closing costs by seller. One slightly below asking price with no closing costs covered by seller. This house was being sold by the owner and he did his own listings.

Despite the offers being solid, he let the offers expire and simply said he received a higher offer when asked... But the houses status never changed on MLS to be under contract. When I asked him why he did that, he said he enjoyed the attention and work of reviewing offers for his house and wanted to see a bid war. I explained his house wasn't worth it to anyone to do a bid war. And he responded it didn't have to be big, but if people fought by throwing around an extra hundred or thousands of dollars it would entertain him enough to sell.

I explained he was wasting people's time, and his response was simple, ""I am old, I only got all the time I got left and I want to have fun."" Mind you, he knew I was trying to buy a house in my local area.

515,realestateinvesting,FHA loan for first house and house hack,"I am looking at buying a smaller starter house that I will then rent out after a year or 2, with the thoughts of moving into either a bigger house or house hacking another property. Housing in my area is fairly cheap and both my fiance and I make approximately $100k each and have 740+ credit scores. We are currently looking at properties in the $100k-$130k range because this would best align with the 1% rule for rents in our area.

I have 2 main questions.

1. If I purchase in my name only and use an FHA loan before we are married (late May wedding), would she later be eligible for an FHA loan? I'm not sure it is worth using up the only FHA loan we would ever qualify for on a lower home value house hack.

2. Are there any major drawbacks to an FHA loan vs conventional besides always having mortgage insurance on an FHA loan? Looking at rates through my credit union a 30 yr conventional is 6.75% with 1.25 points, a 15 yr conventional is 6.125 with .25 points, an FHA 30 yr is 6.375% with 0 points, and a 15 yr FHA is 4.375% with 4.375 points.

We have more than enough to put 20% down on a property that would knock off the PMI insurance on the conventional loan. However, the so much smaller rate on the FHA 15 yr makes me want to go that route. If I'm understanding correctly, the 4.375 points would cost an additional $4,375 at closing for a $100k loan. I know a 15 yr loan is harder to leverage and grow but we aren't looking to quickly scale up a real estate empire. It's just another form of investment we would like to try out and hopefully grow slowly over time."

517,realestateinvesting,Advice on upgrading to larger house then renting.,"My family (central Texas) outgrew our current home right before the pandemic, tried to upgrade to our “forever home” for past few years, but eventually gave up due to stupid over-priced bidding wars and then interest rates. 

Our current home is a small 4 bedroom, appraised at about $300K, less then $100K on mortgage, monthly mortgage payments around $1K, and could rent it out for ~$2K/month.

A nice home in our neighborhood just came up for sale. It’s significantly larger with 4 bed plus 2 offices and extra living room, and it also has a pool which we very much want. The location is perfect as we’d still be by my family and kids friends and same school. It’s just not our “forever home”, but would make a great temporary upgrade in size and quality. 

The house is listed for $390K and we have $100K we’re willing to put down. It’s move-in ready with no work needed. We would plan on keeping our existing home to rent out.

The question is: would this house be suitable to rent out after a few years if/when we find out forever home, or would we probably have to sell it? Not sure we can get rent high enough to cover the mortgage payment plus a little cash flow. We have 4 other rental properties, each cost around $200K with rent at around $1700/month. 

We like the idea of the move if we could add the house to our rental investment portfolio when we eventually move, just not sure it’s a wise investment property. We wouldn’t need cash flow from it to make payments as we’d have a nice down payment and would then also have $3K/month in cash flow from our other properties. The pool is a big consideration in it being a rental as well. 

The house would no doubt appreciate over the years. We’re in one of the hottest markets in the nation and there’s very much a housing shortage.

Is there potential for renting out that size/quality home with not much cash flow? Would it pay off long term, which s really all we’d need."

525,realestateinvesting,Advice on Condo,"Wanted to run this by folks to see if it might make sense.

Context: Currently live in Chicago and will be for a little over a year. Landlord recently came back to us saying he's hiking rent up 30%. Partner and I are likely moving elsewhere in a year for her residency and our plan was to look to potentially house hack in a multifamily first home using either 20% down or 3.5% FHA if it made sense.

I recently stumbled upon a nearby lakefront condo (3BD/2BA 1600 sq ft) for $299K. Price was set at $385K last July and has decreased since then. Unit looks perfectly fine, some parts slightly dated but overall attractive. Comparable units right now rent for $5k to $7k. Rentometer has the 25-75% range at $4600-$6000 typically.

The kicker are the HOA fees at $2200/mo (wowzers). I am familiar that HOAs in these high rises cover a lot, but I would obviously need to get a better understanding for this building (very famous architecture with floor-to-ceiling windows, no doubt lots of upkeep) and what their budget looks like. I feel like this is why the value has been driven down so much in the current market. The building is also listed as both co-op (typically property tax included) and condo, and while listing sites list it as a condo, they assume $0 property tax so I am not sure if that might contribute to the high HOA.

Assuming move-out after a year and rental income of $5k, it seems like I can be even cashflow with a 3.5% FHA loan and have 8-10% CoC with 20% down. Either is doable to me, but I'd likely put in 10% or 15% and decide to make extra payments as desired. That way I can opt to buy another property in 1.5 years if the market is good and I get to better understand my new location's real estate market.

Does this condo seem like a worthwhile option to you or am I dumb paying more in HOA than actual mortgage? I've mostly been looking at future multifamily properties and the returns on them are horrid right now it seems compared to this which is why I'm intrigued in the first place."
526,realestateinvesting,Do I Hold MF Investments or Diversify?,"Hey everyone, I’m looking for a bit of advice. I started investing in real estate part-time with my family a few years ago. One group of investments is a 40-door portfolio of 4-8 unit MF properties in the South. It’s a relatively small market and our properties are class B at best. Rent is around $600-$900 per unit depending on the property. The original investment thesis was to purchase properties that were already relatively stable, didn’t require a big reposition / cash infusion, and to ride the appreciation in the market. 

The market has done well as expected and the portfolio has about doubled in value over the last 5 years. Our rents have increased, but haven’t doubled given that we aren’t doing a big improvement/reposition. The portfolio generated a modest but reasonably good return until inflation really set in. That cut into profits in a meaningful way. I had been thinking that we’ve ridden the wave of appreciation pretty successfully and it might be time to trade up / diversify a bit prior to inflation, but the thought has been more regular recently. 

I really like this market and would like to keep money invested there. I’m considering exploring a 1031 into a commercial property (maybe NNN) within the same market after selling most of the MF portfolio. 

How would you consider options in this situation? We have a healthy cash reserve, just bundled our mortgages and extended them until 2027. We aren’t in danger of needing to sell anything in the immediate future. The goal is to, ideally, diversify, trade up from multiple B properties into one nicer property, and, lastly, generate a bit more cash flow.

530,realestateinvesting,Thinking of buying a college rental - detailed deal analysis in description,"Background:

College rental, 6bd 3bath. Seller is asking just under $700k.

Seller is giving two options: 

1) seller financing at ~1% over prime with a balloon at end of term.

2) conventional financing, but i would have to buy an additional rental (which I am *not* interested in because the numbers definitely don't make sense on it)

The deal analysis:
Gross rent is $6k/mo

Property taxes $2k/yr

With a 75% LTV, I expect PITI with conventional financing to be roughly $3,500/month. 

To account for the fact that the students will invariably trash the place each year, I am going to allocate 3% of the home value for repairs each year. This is roughly $20k.



Vacancy rate will be &lt;5%
Rents to college students and it is a well-known party house.
3 students on lease, 6 actually live there

So for annual performance, I'm seeing:

Gross Rent: $72k

PITI: $42k

Repairs: $20k

Vacancy: $3,600

Rental permit: $500

HOA: $0

This leaves an incredibly slim margin for unforeseen circumstances, very large repairs, a lost year of income from some sort of tenant-induced disaster, etc. 

Perhaps my repair expenses are high, and I'd be looking more at 1% per year. Best case scenario, I'm seeing a net income of $20k/yr. On $170k of equity, that's not worth it to me.  

If I'm overestimating repairs, and underestimating rents, I could see this deal working. But with interest rates no longer being 3-4%, I'm thinking that the numbers aren't worth taking on the headache of a student rental.

Happy to listen to the wise perspectives ehre. Thanks!"

546,realestateinvesting,First time Home Buyer pursuing Financial Freedom in a turbulent market,"Howdy. 

Single 26M making about $150k a year with my day job and side hustles, in Connecticut. I split a 2 bedroom apartment with my dad for $950 a month. We're currently month-to-month. 

My dad also just quit his job and will be making about $1500 a month in social security. 30k in savings for him. 

My ultimate dream is to be able to quit my day job and to be able to live off of passive income. I was originally gonna just try to save as much towards stocks as possible and live off of market returns for the rest of my life, but that dream died when I was overleveraged into the recession and lost most of my life savings. 

Anyway, I've been reset a couple years on my savings, but still have about 100k in the bank and 100k in retirement accounts. 

I now realize that I was not properly diversified in terms of my assets, and that I really should get a house, not necessarily for appreciation, but moreso for the rental income. 

So this has led me to want to house hack. My dad is willing to move with me wherever I go, and pay rent on any place I buy. This makes me think what I need to do next is get a 2-3 family house, have him rent one of the floors, and then I will live on the other. When I wanna move out, I could rent my spot to someone else. This duplex will eventually pay for itself and be an income-generating engine that will contribute to my passive income stream and assist in my early retirement aspirations. 

My concerns are as follows- 

1. Interest rates are so high right now that I feel like I'm throwing away money. Assuming I got a $300,000 mortgage at 6.5% (what I'm approved for right now) that's $19,500 a year thrown away in interest, far surpassing what I'm currently paying in rent. That's before even factoring in property taxes, increased utilities expenses, etc. So the only way to get around that would be to spend a bunch of money out of pocket towards killing off the mortgage as soon as possible, but I've heard this is frowned upon for this strategy as ""cash flow negative"". Is that a viable strategy?
2. I really don't have any confidence that home prices will appreciate in CT in the coming months or years. Our housing prices were pretty stagnant for a long time due to a slowly deteriorating economic situation, part of the reason I never bought a house pre-pandemic. The pandemic came and housing prices went ballistic here like they did everywhere, but now that it's over my deep suspicion is that we will see house prices decline slowly over the next 2 years in this state and then resume their miserable stagnation pattern. I can't really move anywhere else as my job requires me to be around central CT to come into the office. 
3. Mixing business and family is frowned upon for obvious reasons. Renting from my aging father will get more awkward as he gets older, obviously. 
4. All the above points being said, there is some value in my quality-of-life improving as a result of leaving my $950 apartment. I don't like where I live, and I aspire to something better. But I struggle mentally with quantifying such a thing into a dollar amount. 

Does anyone here have any thoughts on what I should do next? 

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this long wall of text. This is my first home and so there's a lot of cold feet I have here, the current market conditions haven't made things any less stressful."

I plan to buy and rent a property to one of my family members. The houses are going for approximately 150k - 200k. I have about 150k cash on hand.

Should I put 20-30% down on each house or just buy one house outright?

\&gt;&gt;Now, recent declines are a sign that many tenants have maxed out on how much of their income they can devote to rent, while the specter of layoffs has created new concerns for some. Other would-be renters, living with family or friends, remain sidelined by prices that are still far too high for their budgets. 

&amp;#x200B;

While some seasonal stalling in rents is normal, the market faces a significant headwind in the biggest delivery of new supply since 1986, according to projections from CoStar Group. Nearly half a million new apartments are coming on line this year as developers seek to cash in on the high rents that tenants have been paying. Many renters are unable to afford to buy a home because of higher mortgage rates and steep prices, so rentals have been in high demand."

The general advice I see here is to not mention anything to the lender, but some other boards suggest that they could foreclose if they find out without us disclosing. I assume they would find out when we convert our insurance away from residential to landlord, or when we lose our residential exemption on taxes (We pay our taxes through the mortgage escrow). 

If this is the case should we reach out anyway in good faith and let the lender know? Any advice appreciated!"
553,realestateinvesting,Property Rental - Manage by Professional Management Company vs. Realtor,"Planning to rent out primary residence as my family is moving to a new locale.  I've shopped around for property managers since I won't be local (moving to CA; current property is in NY).  Found a property management company with good ratings and offering 8% monthly fee structure and no on-boarding fees to set up and rent the property.  This company is also offering one-month free management if they're unable to rent the property in the first 30 days of being listed.  

I asked my realtor (who is also a personal friend) about property management and he's provided a similar offer to manage my property (8% monthly management; no on-boarding fees).  I imagine he would outsource management at some level if he took on management.

I'm leaning towards going with the property management company over the realtor - just to keep things clean and not mix friendship/business.  I also think the property management company may have better payment systems for processing tenant payments and such.

561,realestateinvesting,Paying a lot of points for an investment or owner-occupied property,"Hi all,

I have looked at previous posts on this sub about this but couldn’t reach a clear answer.

So I always thought that points were something lenders wanted to sell, make money on, and something not worth paying for as an investor. 

However with current rates, I started doubting myself a bit.

Looking at transparent quotes from AimLoan.

An owner occupied 4-plex for $272,000 with 25% down. I know, it’s more than 20% which other lenders accept - first problem.

They give you literally 10 different rate options.

The two most extreme ones: 

1) $1,527 in lender fees, 0.261 points, total lender and 3rd party costs $4,059. Total cash to close $74,828.

6.75% rate, $1,323 payment. 

2) $9,402 in lender fees, including 4,121 points for $8,407, and $82,598 to close. 

5.5% rate, $1,158 payment. 

So this comparison suggests I break even in 4 years.

Downsides of buying points, as far as I know:

1) More money down = less money for next deals;

2) If rates go down enough within first 4 years, refinancing means I lose money, so I lose flexibility and it makes less sense to sell.

However, here are my counter arguments.


While the rates might go down, who knows if they would drop this much. We could speculate, but your guess is as good as mine. I think it’s reasonable to say we won’t see rates below 4% on owner occupied properties for a very long time, and while 5% is possible, I am not able to predict that.

2) If my investment meets my expected returns at 6.75% interest without points, then paying 4% in points boosts  CoC.

For example 25% down with 3% closing costs at 6.75% results in 6.4% CoC while 25% down with 7% closing costs results in 7.58% CoC on this particular deal. It might not be a deal worth pursuing for other reasons, but it does show my point.


What are your thoughts? If the goal is holding for 10+ years, then isn’t this a nice hedge? 

Give all counterarguments you can!"

564,realestateinvesting,"Development - Rising rates, Rising Costs, and Expiring Entitlements","I'm sitting on a 30 unit entitled condo/townhome development in a resort/luxury market - about 2/3 of the units would be considered entry-level for the market, the other 1/3 are high-end townhomes. I own the land outright. I'm at an impasse on whether to proceed, sell, or wait it out. While no one can predict the future, most people would agree that in all likelihood, we're sailing into a storm. The thought of building into this environment feels like jumping off of a roof and hoping the ground will turn into a pool by the time you land.

Given the rising interest rate environment, a tight/high priced labor market, and continuing cost creep with inflation - I cannot see a path forward for construction to preserve entitlement. Once the entitlement expires, a renewed application will be held to a different standard as the zoning code has been amended since entitlement to discourage high-end or 2nd home housing (a significant buyer demographic in resort markets), and would significantly impact the project.

What would you do ?

I have spent a lot of time researching a “hot market” with a lot of appreciation potential (LCOL). In this area, it is very challenging to find cash flow properties, but there is a good chance for both sale price and rent appreciation and cash flow will likely increase in the long term as rates come down. 

I recently looked at the market near where I grew up and it seems like there is much better cash flow potential, but I know there will be little to no appreciation especially compared to the hot market (HCOL). It is close by so likely wouldn’t need a property manager and know contractors in the area. 

If long term cash flow is my ultimate goal, which path would make more sense?

588,realestateinvesting,Considering trading in my tech equity for real estate,"Current situation

## Holdings
- $1.5M index funds (**not touching this*. Just letting it grow**)
- $2M in equity in a private tech startup. This is not liquid currently and potentially could go to 0.
- bunch of equity in 2 properties in Europe that I'm not counting
- I own two small tech companies. (**This is what I want to shift to real estate**)

- I have a surplus of about $120k each year after taxes and spending. This money has just been going into index funds so far.

----

I have reason to believe my two small tech companies will not last 5+ years, and while I am trying to build more tech companies, I am considering diversifying into real estate.

**Problem #1**: My income source will probably only last about 5 more years.

I own property in Europe, where I live, but I am from a small but growing college town in the US, where I will buy and remotely manage with a trusted PM I grew up with.

**Problem #2**: Remote (but trusted) PM for my properties.

Assuming I buy my first property in cash for $250k, rents go for $1500 in that town for a 3b2ba, I am thinking of using the first property to leverage buying another SFH. Then I will use leftover income from company A/B for down payments for 1 new property per year for 5ish years. I'm not looking for great deals, just A or B-level rentals that can keep tenants.

If I can get 10 properties with a net cash flow positive of $1k a month each, it would supplement $120k year expenses without having to touch my savings, but I don't think that's doable in a reasonable amount of time.

**Problem #3**: I want to max cash flow at the 5-year mark. Market timing seems bad for a lot of leverage.

In order to hit $1k+ cash flow, the numbers are tight. I would have to outright own a home to see that kind of return factoring in taxes, PM, repairs, unless I get amazing interest rates, which I won't in this market.

So the timeline looks like this: I take $250k out of my index funds to get the first property and then use $120k or so surplus each year to buy more, and then buy down debt to increase cash flow.



Year | Properties | Prop Count CashFlow&gt;$1k | Equity/Debt
---|---|----|----
1 | 2 | 1 | 350/150
2 | 3 | 1 | 470/320
3 | 4 | 1 | 600/470
4 | 4 | 2 | 750/320
5 | 4 | 2 | 900/170
6 | 4 | 4 | 1.1M/0
7 | 6 | 4 | 1.25M/300

At year 6, I would have another $48k cash flow, which doesn't make up for my current spending, but it does get me about half way there.

I would also have about $1M in real estate with no debt that I could use to continue the leverage cycle, and maybe the interest rates will be more favorable.

Is this too simplistic of a plan?"

The rent for this property is about 2300 month.  The make ready cost is about 15k and I’d say 35k to make it real nice.  I’ve only Purchased turnkey properties and look for the highest COC return.  I don’t know what the best loan I should consider for this property.

If i fix and flip besides realtor commissions what cost do I have to think about or taxes?  My last option is just to do the rehab out of pocket and rent and maybe 5 years get my capital back?

600,realestateinvesting,Triplex question,"Triplex

Hi - there’s a triplex in a high end neighborhood where I live. Homes are in the 3-4 million range on average. It’s a 3680 square foot home split as 2b2b, 2b1b, 2b1b. The two 2b1bs are already spoken for - apparently rent controlled and make 5050 combined. Leaving the 2b2b Available to live in or rent out. 
The house is on the market for 2.6 million dollars….. 
can anyone make sense of this as an investment opportunity? 2.6 million in this neighborhood for a large home with 6 bedrooms is a reasonable cost - however - 4 rooms are occupied rent controlled at only 5050 a month?? Meaning on a mortgage the remaining 2b2b would account for 11-12 thousand dollars a month to break even? 

Any thoughts???"

Just curious what people's thoughts are on that? 

Do you only buy houses that will cash flow with all equity removed?

\- Transferring from community college to a 4-year (In South California) in \~6 months in Finance

\- I'm planning to live with 2 other friends all of us equally paying rent/utilities/etc...

Now my question is what options are available. The most obvious and easy answer points to just renting out in the area of the 4-year university but I'm very hesitant because of how high the rent prices are. I'm wondering if there is any other options with housing that would be viable for 3 roommates. I thought about looking into an FHA loan for a house but everyone tells me that not only do I not have enough proof of income ($25 an hour working part-time currently for past year) but also that the market is ""bad"" right now and how it's not smart. I'm just wondering if renting is the only/best option for me and my friends or if there's a way to make something else work out. I already plan to invest in real estate 100% in the future but I'm curious if this could be my first step. Thank all in advance."

They are asking for a new roof, chimney repointed, plumbing stack moved (they put estimate $24k). I had a roof inspection done that says there are 4-5 years of estimated life on the roof, the roof doesn’t presently leak and a quote for $12k for new roof. The disclosures did disclose that the roof is 16 years old. The home is in New England and there is a stone wall on the property. They want this old stone wall repointed and have put “estimated $8k in repairs through a licensed landscaping company”. This seems ridiculously excessive to me. We priced the house accordingly keeping in mind that the roof while functioning was older, and it’s a 100+ year old home in New England. Many homes here have older stone walls on the property. How would you react to these requests?"

I am just looking for a range. From best case to absolute disaster worse case, and what that scenario looks like. 

The property has two homes on one lot, both built in 1900. All drain pipes are old cast iron. 

There are 4 cesspools. Not sure which are active and which are not. 

I am looking to estimate the cost connecting to sewer for both houses. 

There is a 100 foot paved driveway from the street to in between the two houses. The current cesspools are also located under the driveway between the two houses. 

This is in the northeast. 

Can anyone provide some estimates ranges for the full project? 

Including anything that has to do with the driveway, the fact that there are multiple cesspools and that there is cast iron piping.

623,realestateinvesting,Can I have your advice ?,"Can I kindly ask for your advice before I make my first large investment ? 

I live in a pretty expensive city in the Bay Area. Average single family homes are about 800k. 

I have about 500k in cash and want to purchase my first property. I have a wife and a 1 year old and we may be planning to have another baby within 2-4 years from now. 

My first thought was I wanted to buy a duplex or triplex in the city where I live for about 750-950k. Using all my cash and taking a loan for the rest, and then living in one of the units. 

However, I’ve talked with a few mortgage brokers and banks and I may only be able to get about a 700k-800k loan if I put 500k down. I have a newish job and although I have ok income the last few years and good credit they’re reluctant to loan much. On top of that, duplex’s and triplex’s in my city are like little nuggets of gold. There are very few of them and when one pops up investors jump on them….even now. And most of them need at least some work. 

The three of us currently live in a small one bedroom apartment and we really want something bigger as soon as possible. 

I’m now thinking about just giving in on the idea of buying a duplex or triplex and just buying a single family home. We would be very happy with that although we’d have a mortgage (instead of tenants paying our mortgage) and it might not be the wisest investment. 

Another option is buying a duplex or triplex somewhere cheaper like the Sacramento area, where you can easily get one for 500-600k. We could then use the rental income to rent something bigger in our hometown. 

Another option is just sit and wait, put the cash in a high yield savings, and just hope more multi family properties pop up
In our local market in the next year, which may or may not happen. 

We feel so tired or waiting and just truly want to buy something. Looking forward to your advice and feel free to ask any questions you might have. 

Thanks"

I am a buy and hold investor - have bought a handfull of houses now, and for the last 2, have worked with a realtor that rebated 45% of his buyers agent commission back to me after closing.   The first time, I found him through a national referral site - can't remember what it was, probably for agents more getting started.  The second time - I made a deal with him -  I'd be choosy, I wouldn't make him show me 10 houses and then not buy any of them - we'd only see the houses I was 90% certain I'd put an offer down on.     


If we sold, I'd probably find an agent that would agree to the same thing - I'd take photos, they'd put the listing together, and the other side would do the showing - really a small amount of work for my agent.

635,realestateinvesting,"I wanna get into real estate (BRRR) asap, but I'm kinda lost.","One of the reasons I want to get into real estate is because I want to retire my parents eventually(64)(60), although I know it might take a few years hence I want to start asap.

I've been advice to just do some flippings to start getting some cash, to eventually be able to do the BRRR method with my own money. Now so far I've read about two methods, one with hard lenders and the other one using your own money. 

Should I wait since I don't have the cash for a property yet? or is the hard lender route safe?

&amp;#x200B;

So far these are the two methods I found out there:

1. Buy a property putting around 30% down and the rest through a hard lender, rehabit it (hard lender), refinance with the bank, so you can pay the hard lender back asap and get your initial investment back, rent it, so you pay the bank with that money, and also make about $200 in proffit (praying you won't have to spend that money in repairs soon). And with the initial investment you get back, do it all again.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Buy a property cash, using your own money, rehabit it (your own money), get a loan through the bank, putting that property as collateral, so you can get your initial investment back, rent it and then do it all again.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I really don't know which one of these is the way to go, or if there's a better way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll probably have the cash for a property to do the second method in a couple years, so maybe the first one is more suitable for me since I want to start soon, or should I wait?

&amp;#x200B;

Also I know someone that has been doing the first method for a few years now and he's doing really well, He told me he finds the properties using an app called realtor. com, then he only uses about 30k to 40k (more only if he got the property ridiculously cheap) and then rents them to the government for section 8, meaning he gets paid $1500 per month, for a 3 bedrooms unit and $1200 for a 2 bed.

He said he would charge me about 10k for guiding me through the process, but I want to see what I can do on my own first I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Would you mind sharing some wisdom and possibly pointing something I'm missing? Maybe there's a better way or something I should avoid at all costs.

Anything you could share would be highly appreciated.

I’ve never flipped a house, nor do I intend to be a house flipper and this project didn’t have any business ties, the bills (contractors, materials, etc) were paid personally. 

I’m hopeful this would qualify for long term gains as it was owned for over a year, but seeing some things that make it seem that I may get crushed with a flip and some other self employment taxes on top of it all. 

Happy to answer any questions or share additional information as needed to get to the bottom of it!

638,realestateinvesting,Recently Sold homes on Zillow were never listed prior to sale. How do I get in on these?,"First time home buyer here. Ive been watching Zillow and Realtor everyday for months. A trend that I've seen that is driving me crazy is that when i search by ""Sold homes"", I'll frequently see homes that sold just days prior that I'm confident were never listed on the site as ""For Sale"". What is especially frustrating about this is these homes are always much nicer for the money as well. I'd conservatively estimate they are 30% cheaper, or 30% nicer for the price than the ""For Sale"" houses that are still available.

I theorize that what is listed for sale is obviously overpriced for what it is, otherwise people would be snatching it up. And these sold homes were sold pre-listing through connected agents.

My question for everyone here; How do I find out about these nicer homes that apparently get sold prior to even being listed? Is it as simple as hiring a connected RE agent so i can find out about houses just coming on the market? 

Just knowing there are homes out there that are selling right now that are much better for the money than what is available right now makes me not want to make an offer on anything until i can get in on one of these pre-listing sales.

Anyone else experience something similar? I invite you to check out  the ""Sold homes on Zillow or Realtor and I guarantee if you've been keeping an eye on stock, you'll see a ton of homes that were bought before ever being listed for sale on the site."

This way I can pay down the principal faster, thus still achieve a pretty good return, and at least lock in a small amount of cheap debt, increase my equity in the property for 5 years, and when rates become lower in the future, do a 1031 exchange for a higher value and higher return property, and get cheap debt at that time."

655,realestateinvesting,Difficult Decision - hold on or cut losses?,"I'm sorry for the longer post, but I feel it sets up the situation I find myself in. I think I screwed up, but I don't know if I should keep holding on or sell and cut losses.

Bought a long term rental duplex Nov 2021. Everything went pretty smoothly and I thought I was the man - equity went up and cash flow was good for the property from the start.

Then I want to try STR and in 2022 October closed with the goal of a renovation and rent out mid December. The numbers looked great prior to purchasing I used multiple analytic sites to figure out conservative ADR and occupancy. The renovation and repairs ended up costing double and I didn't have a rental until the end of January. The numbers right now look bad because slow season lasts until the summer (June).

Back to the duplex that was cash flowing I had two major leaks/repairs and had to spend all the cash reserves from 2022 on the first leak and just had to use my own funds for the second issue.

Right now, I feel desperate. I already have sold some holdings in brokerage to meet the mortgage and other expenses both personal and in the rentals. I think I should be able to clear this month, but I'll have to keep selling more from my retirement accounts to keep this going.

I'm banking on a good tax return to help and I don't like that.

My thesis for holding on is the summer months for the STR should generate substantially more revenue and I could build cash reserves again. The duplex hopefully won't have any more issues and by the end of the year the cash generated should offset the personal contribution I had to make to the major repair.

My fear is none of these things will happen and I'll keep having to rob Peter (sell retirement holdings) to pay Paul (keep paying for all personal and rental expenses). Prior to buying the STR, life was fine and i didn't worry about money. I could invest in retirement and spend smartly and pay all bills.

I guess I'm asking at what point would you suggest enough is enough and better to cut the losses or hold on for longer.

Thank you for your time and appreciate your feedback and experiences."

I understand cities with big industries and campuses are great spaces to invest, but how do you find out what industries are where in the first place?

Thank you all for any responses! I know this is a bit general so mods I beg of you please don’t take this down!"

663,realestateinvesting,Buying now as an springboard to a future dream...,"Hello all, so I'll start by saying currently I am not a Real Estate Investor and have very little aspiration to become a full time one. However, I admire those who do and wish I had the work ethic and know-how to pursue that as a career

My story starts with a life long dream my wife and I have to retire and spend our golden years in Hawaii. We've gone a few times and fallen in love and know this is what we want for our futures. Being as we currently live on the East Coast and are about 20-25 years away... I know prices are only going to continue skyrocketing. 

So the thought came to me... Why not buy a house or condo NOW at today's prices, and own it as a rental properly until the time comes for us to retire. I figure I'm not looking to get rich or make major money off this property, but if rent can pay down the mortgage and taxes, obviously we'd need a property manager as well. We'll have a property ready to go.

Is this a viable idea? Are there any major issues I'll encounter? It makes so much sense to me, I know I must be missing something... So I come to the true experts."

667,realestateinvesting,Need help evaluating loan options,"Need help evaluating loan options

Looking at my first investment property, a duplex in Minnesota priced at 450k

Right now I have these two loan options through two different lenders:

Option 1:

30 year conventional

25% down

7.625%

2 points 

$1200 origination fee

Title services and lender title insurance: $1,900

Owners title insurance: $550


Option 2: (lenders notes below)

Rate today is 6.43% -  to be finalized a week before closing

Half point (reduced from 1%) underwriting fee $1,500


1st position commercial real estate mortgage and assignment of rents


5 year term, 20 year amortization

You will personally guarantee the loan

You will cover property taxes and insurance on your own – these are not escrowed

Borrower paid routine closing costs.  Good faith estimates
Appraisal $600-$800
Title $3,400
Misc $500
Bank underwriting fee $1,600
I’m not sure how broker fees are paid
5,4,3,2,1  prepayment penalty only if refinanced with a different bank
NO covenants


Option 2 seems better based on lower rate and no points, what concerns me is the 5 year term, the way he explained it is you basically have to go through this entire process every 5 years, and get the rate renewed at whatever it is at that time. He said they likely won’t call the loan in, (unless we have major financial issues)…..

I give them 24 hours to accept the offer, and I know for a fact we’re the first ones to put in a full price offer. Every time. Without fail. “Here comes 3 other interested parties.” I HATE the realtor games. The second I hear that it’s a highest and best situation, when I offered full price &amp; they suddenly want to play “outbid yourself”, I terminate. I refuse to believe houses sit empty for 3,6,9 months then suddenly have an explosion of interest when I suddenly do. Sure realtors can see these other supposed offers but why can’t we as the consumer?

I’ve found my angle: I find 2 houses that are comparable &amp; send out offers on both and I tell the selling realtor this. First to sign gets their house sold. First to “highest and best me” or “can we hold off another 24 hours bc there’s 2 more showings” get thrown away. 

If a consumer gives a full price offer, and it’s the only offer, with a 24 limit, legally the seller should HAVE to accept it.

My family is about to close on a home we will move into that is 2 1/2 hours away. The lender wants a signed lease for a tenant to replace us in our current and primary home to start no more than 60 days from closing. 60 days from closing lands us about five weeks from the end of school for our kids. We want to stay in our current house about five weeks past when our new tenant is supposed to move in. We have family in the area we can stay with, but would prefer to stay in our home for that time. What would you do?

1. We could live with family (not preferable, as it would add nearly an hour of work commuting and school commute for my kindergartener). 

2. Or maybe we can get the lease signed for the date our lenders want and then discuss with the tenant to see if they are flexible and willing to move in a little later. 

3. OR, a questionably ethical option would be to create a fake lease just to appease the lender and then rent out our departing residence at our convenience. Is this illegal? Fraud? Would I go to prison?? —kind of joking. 

Anyone have some thoughts?"

698,realestateinvesting,"Sometimes more income doesnt mean more property, just more doors. Divide. And multiply.","The urge to look at another property is always there (the danger of the thrill of the hunt and the deal lol), but after looking at numerous properties over the years, for us the best way to make more income is to divide and multiply.

I dont buy anything but single family houses. Easier to buy, easier to sell, no condo fees, no HOA's in our area, lots of parking, lots of room to grow. And that last one is the key.

With 5 houses our gross income is 10,000 a month. But we can add basement suites to two of the house without much hassle. Im good at finding deals like used kitchen cupboards for 500 - 800, so I can do a whole basement suite for about 15k if I do most of the labor myself, finished with appliances in place ready to rent. When you can pull 1200 out of that suite, it makes total sense to build, it'll be paid for in a year.

The other bonus of buying older SFH's is that the lots are generally large. Which means putting a garden home/back alley home on them is possible without even taking away much space from the yard and the primary renter. We can do this on two of our properties and Ive found used building that can be converted for about 10k each. 

And the last property would qualify for a garage suite. The nice but expensive way to do it would be to add another storey on the garage and put a two bedroom suite up there. But since the goal is increasing revenue without spending a ton of money, we are going to turn half the existing garage into a suite. Since its got a 10 ft ceiling it will even have a loft bedroom without taking away floor space.

So without buying any more property, our plan is to add rent from two more basement suites (1100 + 1200), two small backyard homes (800 + 900) and a garage suite (1000) and increase our revenue by 5000 a month after spending about 65,000 for renovations.

You can buy a house in some small towns around here but that 65k, but you arent going to get more than 1000/mo out of rent.

If we take it slow we can do this over time without borrowing much other than off the line of credit short term to buy supplies.

705,realestateinvesting,Lake house Investing - Advice,"Hey everyone, looking for some advice or flaws (financially and decision making wise) with my plan to buy a lakefront property for my first real estate purchase, outside of my main residency. I’ve been saving up money to purchase a lakefront property in Maine that I will be renting out short term as an Airbnb rental. The options that exist are between a few properties about an hour north of Portland or about forty five minutes outside of Acadia. Still unsure which will generate the most guests. There’s more options to north of Acadia then the lakes north of Portland, yet it’s further up the coast (I live in NJ). 

     To start, I’m planning on purchasing a lot of land and then constructing a log home on it. The lots range from 50-75k with the soil tested and surveying complete. Power, water and sewer planning will be taken into account beforehand. The log home company estimates the total construction of the home to be 375k turnkey. I’m planning to buy the vacant lot 100% with cash. For the construction of the home I have about 25% (100k) of the 375k saved up. I have an additional 50k reserved for this project, just in case things go south, but I really don’t want to touch that if I don’t have to. 

     My TWO biggest concerns lie within the domain of HOA and finding a property management company to take care of the short rentals. In terms of the property management company, I have a feeling that I’ll have better luck finding a reputable company in Portland rather than the area surrounding Acadia National Park. Even then, I feel like it will be difficult as most of the ideal lakes to invest in are to the northeast of Lake Sebago, which is about an hour to an hour and a half from Portland. I feel like it I’ll be hard to find a company/person willing to commit to that job, especially with the low population of people that live out there. That’s my first issue, which is a massive issue. The second issue lies within committing to this entire investment knowing that almost all lakes have some sort of HOA involvement. I understand that they’re to PROTECT everyone with their investments however there’s no guarantee that they won’t change their tune about denying airbnbs from continuing on THEIR lake in the future, whether it’s 5 or 10 years down the line. That factor is scary to me, which is why I’m hesitant. While I make a decent living as a teacher, I am certainly not in the upper middle class so I want this investment to be as concrete as possible. I want to succeed.

      Does anyone have any advice, critiques or experience with a similar situation?"

The properties are in high demand areas and the principle balances are 1/4 of what the condos are currently valued at.

The property that we have to find a new lender/financing for is currently leased. I have my own duplex in another city. I assume that would help a bit.

Would a down payment be necessary in this type of situation? Or does this work more as a refinance? We would prefer not to have to put down a 20% + down payment.

So, if the property LLC owns the house along with the rest of the property, and the LLC has the debt and is making the payments, we have to pay the LLC to cover the mortgage. But does that mean we’d have to setup a rental agreement and pay rent to ourselves, or is there a simpler way? My understanding is that we’d lose the mortgage deduction on our tax returns if we “rented” instead of “owning.”  But we own the LLC outright - it’s just a layer."

Only caviat is the neighborhood is garbage and the exterior is stucco (which needs to be remediated and some point) which I can’t afford. I was under contract to sell it last summer and they backed out because of this. Being a landlord is also a pain and I’m over it, whatever money I make is constantly going back into repairs and maintenance and turnovers/rerenting the home.
 I Pay about $1900 a month, once the tax abatement is over it will be around $2400 total in 2025. I rent one 4 bed 2 ba for $1500 section 8 so that’s guaranteed monthly and the second unit is going to be vacant but would rent 3 bed 2 ba $1400 which I would be doing section 8 also.
(Reason being I hate hunting people down for late payments). Market rents aren’t much higher either.

Long story short. I owe 345k currently, I was offered 315k cash.

Should I Eat the 30k loss and be headache free (this is half of my savings so that would suck but I feel as I would be way happier).. am I able to negotiate a short sale with the bank so I would be off the hook for 315k instead of the whole 345k since I’ve never missed a payment, there’s also no PMI.

Or try to list it on MLS and make it as-is so I don’t run into a buyer wanting the stucco remediated. ( granted that the interior units are totally fine and updated.) I would probably list it for around 375k and after fees and a sellers credit I would probably walk away with around 340? If I’m lucky to get a full ask offer.

Any advice is greatly appreciated."

740,realestateinvesting,Sell or keep rental with 750k in equity,"I have a rental property in HCOL city, it’s cash flow positive on Airbnb at the tune of about 5k a month on average after expenses. Issue is I’m finally moving out the city, I have to rent long term but I’m in an overly tenant friendly city. I have heard horror stories. Cash flow will be about 3k a month. Less work for me than short term renting but I have a fear of dealing with squatters and people destroying the property. And will also possibly have to get a property manager which will lower cash flow. 

I can sell it for 1.5 million and that’s purposefully lowballed given the current market. I bought it for 350k decades ago and did a cash out refinance to do a full gut renovation (all new everything) as my mortgage stands at 700k. It used to be my home for more context so I have an emotional attachment to it.

I’m very conflicted, take the money and run but best place to put the profit? Buy another property in a landlord friendly city? Or just hold with long term tenants and hope for the best?"

My husband and I are in our mid-20's and looking to buy a house. So far we haven't found anything we loved- at least not in any areas of town we'd like to be. I recently found a house for sale by owner. It's in a desirable neighborhood where houses don't come up often (at least not ones that fit our wants/needs). 
This house is beautiful, but bare bones for $1m. It's also been sitting for sale for awhile which raises some orange flags. My husband is understandably apprehensive as we don't really have firsthand experience dealing with major projects like this. He has worked as a carpenter, and I grew up in a 100 year old home that underwent a full remodel.. to give you an idea of what we're familiar with lol. I feel like we could make this our dream home but it could also just be a nightmarish headache. 

I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to take a look and let me know their thoughts. Thank you in advance!

747,realestateinvesting,Putting 150K-200K cash into real estate every year - a newbie!,"So I am a newbie that wants to get into real estate investing and I’m looking for some advice from experienced investors. Some background information. I am a civil engineer and work as an independent consultant. My wife is the same. We are both 39 years old. No kids but plan to have one soon. We live in South Florida but have (aging) parents that live in northern Virginia. For his reason, at some point in the next 5 to 10 years, we will spend half the year in northern Virginia (London or Clarke county to be more precise).

We already max our 401Ks and HSAs. We have also recently started investing in VTSAX periodically. We would like to get into real estate investing, as well. 

Between two of us, we forecast that can save up to 150K to 200K every year for the next 10 years. As we work full time jobs, at this time we wouldn’t have much time (and we don’t prefer) to find tenants and actively manage any properties. We could perhaps dedicate 15-20 hours per week as necessary. 

Given the high level information above, and the current economy, could you share some tips as to what you would do if you were us? What type of real estate, which markets/cities, what type of leverage and what price range we should be looking into? Thanks in advance for everyone’s feedback."

749,realestateinvesting,ADU Garage conversion,"Hello r/realestateinvesting 

I have an interesting situation regarding a ADU garage conversion. Quick backstory, after my brother and I graduated college my mom decided to rent out our house and downsize to a 1 bedroom condo. My brother found a job in the same city, and decided to to convert the garage into a 1 bd 1 bath apartment with a fenced off section of the front yard. Due to how long the permit process took, my brother found an apartment and does not want to move in to the ADU. He has saved for a majority of the construction costs. Everything is permitted, but construction has not started. 

I am helping my brother with the construction portion of the ADU. I have found several contractors to give us estimates, and an working on getting energy efficiency rebates while we upgrade parts of the main house and ADU. 

I am wondering how we can structure an agreement for the rent of the ADU so that my brother and I both feel comfortable. He will contributing 90% of the costs, I will be contributing 10% of the costs, and overseeing the progress of the construction. The general idea is AFTER we have collected back our construction costs we will split the rent 1/3 going to our mother, 1/3 going to my brother, and 1/3 going to me. That being said may take 30 years before my brother recovers the amount he put in. 

I was thinking a 90/10 split of rent until we recover the construction costs, and then moving to an even split between 3 of us. If my mother for whatever reason does not want her 1/3, then it reverts to 50/50 split between us. 

Please let me know your thoughts. The house is located in Los Angeles."

752,realestateinvesting,Help finalize the deal,"So I’ve been negotiating this duplex back and forth via agent. They listed at $130, I offered $106, they countered at $120, I offered $110, and communication stalled.

They owned the property for 3 years, rehabbed it, had terrible tenants they evicted, fixed a pipe that burst and want out. 

They owe ~73K on their mortgage (will be important later) 

I budget for $10K of rehab. 

Today I decided to call the seller myself, foregoing the agent.

He was very thrilled to talk and said the agent never even made a $110K offer! He asked if I could do better.

So I offered two options:

1) $110K cash;
2) I pay $120K. $80K now and $40K in 4 years. This way they pay off their mortgage and walk away and I get good cash flow for a while. 

He was extremely interested in option 2 and looks like we’re almost done. 

In that case, here is the deal flow:

1) Pay 80K to him, put 10 in rehab, refinance at ~140K at ~65% LTV. I pull out my entire $90K this way. 

2) i think fair rent estimate is $750 a door, or $1500 a month. 

3) Expenses - 5% vacancy, 10% management, 10% maintenance, ~10% taxes and insurance, ~10% utilities. NOI 53% or $9580 a year. Debt service at 7.25% and $90K of debt is $6,933, so I cash flow $2646 a year with 0 money in the deal. 

4) I will actually self manage which increases cash flow to $4,356 a year. In 4 years it’s $17,424 of cash flow. 

5) I underwrote rents conservatively. If I assumed $825 rents and self management, then $27,580 of cash flow in 4 years. 

So what do you guys think? The idea is to leverage free money for 4 years and then pay off the rest of balloon with my other savings. 

I get $17-27K of cash flow in 4 years, and then will be maximum $13-23K of my own money in. 


P.S. just for comparison, if I paid $110K cash + 10K rehab and then BRRRed, i’d be getting 8-16% CoC at 25% LTV, depending on rents being $750 or $825. 

The thing that bothers me here is that although the property easily beats the 1% rule, high utilities cause NOI margins to be below 60%. 

Thanks!"

754,realestateinvesting,"First time (proper) rental, negative cash flow, cold feet.","I live in a college town with a strong rental market due to the transient population. I have some longer term investments that should help us massively in retirement but have had some other investments mature and have been looking to diversify and make some cash-flowing investments to supplement salary. I have a pretty well paid job, but it is stressful and I would like to return to more freelance based work on my own terms.

My plan was to purchase a number of properties locally over the next 5 years along with some other alternative investments, and have a management company manage them until I scale back at work. We rented our previous house after moving so I appreciate the amount of work that goes into renting.

I told a realtor friend of my plan a month or so ago and she has been sending me a number of properties but in the current market conditions, the numbers just haven't been adding up. Even with the numbers not adding up, the properties are selling within 24 hours, if they even make it to the market. Last weekend she sent me a 4 bed condo off the market for $275,000, currently renting for $1800 (under lease until summer of next year) but in development that can averages $2,000.

I crunched some numbers and came to the conclusion that while it would not cashflow much, I could refinance later and when the rents went up, it would positively cash flow. Due to the growing enrollment of the college, we've never really seen a dip in prices, even in 2008. Just a variance in the rate of appreciation. So by my predictions, I thought even if it didn't cashflow much, in 10 years we could sell and still handily beat investing the money in the markets (figuring a 3% appreciation vs an 8% compounded rate in the markets).

Real estate is moving so fast here, that I looked at an empty partner unit and at my friends suggestion, put in an offer at $290,000 before viewing. There were 3 other offers site-unseen but our higher price was accepted ($2,500 earnest). The offer is contingent on the home inspection which is tomorrow.

Well, then we really got into the number crunching with the lender. As I rented my previous property before and the rate was locked in, I was unaware of all the adjustments for getting a mortgage on a rental property. I was calculating at 6.5% with lower tax rates, but our current best offers are putting 20% down with a $5600 buy down to get a 7.625% rate or putting 25% down with an $80 buy down to get a 7.625% rate. I do have the cash to put more down, but the plan was to make multiple investments and not put all my eggs in one basket.

At 20%, figuring in taxes, insurance, HOA and management fees, I'm looking at a negative cashflow of around $500 each month &amp; with 25% down it is \~ -$400. I do believe that the value will appreciate well overtime &amp; rates will drop at some point so we can refinance (of course nothing is certain). But the scenario has quickly gone from “It will cash flow a small amount” to “It won’t make any money but it is still a good long term investment if we sell in 10 years” to “well we’ll actually lose money, but it should still beat the market as an option if we can take advantage of tax relief on other 'passive' investments”. That last scenario could be helpful with other cash flowing investments, but I feel like I'm trying to look for the positives when the initial plan was to generate monthly income.

I am going to the home inspection tomorrow (to get my first look) and am leaning towards finding something that allows me to break the contract, which is pretty disheartening. I'm not sure how the local buyers are making it work currently, but I presume there are a lot of cash buyers purchasing for their kids coming here for school.

We'll see how I feel after the inspection but if anyone has any thoughts, please chime in! I really wanted to invest locally, but it looks like I may be smarter going out of state."

Bare minimum, it’s a house that would need extreme renovations. There’s a good chance it would need to be demolished. **The owner is selling it as-is.** The sale is not dependent on an approved inspection.

My wife and I can max bid $450k, so $50k over asking price. What are the odds that someone would outbid our max offer?

I was trying to find details online about how much lots will auction for, and what percent over asking is considered too high. 

From those basic google searches it seemed like people typically don’t go over 5% of the asking—but I’m not confident in my research. If we offered 50k over asking, that would put us at 12% over—is that enough to outbid?

I have been in the landscaping industry throughout high school and the guy i worked with rented a small lot with a shipping container as his shop. 

This got me thinking… theres obviously a demand for workshops/equipment parking for these contractors and theres plenty if recourses nearby, so the area is great. 

Picture this: a 4/5 acre lot with a 60ft pole barn sitting on a large concrete pad, which is then surrounded by stone to drive in. The pole barn could have a wall separating the structure in halves, making this property available to two companies to rent (sorta like a duplex). Then add a bathroom with a shower and a slop sink as well as a small office. (Making it more attractive and increase the rent). The land could possibly be fenced in as well. 

I would say the land would be about 150k, the barn about 50-60k, the concrete pad about 20k (plus some other expenses- maybe tack on 15k) so in total like 250k for the investment. 

I feel like since this would be like a commercial property, rent could go for like 2500/month or more. 

What do you guys think? Is this a feasible idea? Do you think those numbers are accurate? Could you get a loan for this type of thing? How effective would it be?

Thanks for reading, love to hear what you guys think. I cant seem to find anyone talking about something like this to do my own research."

Option 2 - I can buy 1/2 acre outright and still work for others as I earn enough to build the business.

So I'm prepping my taxes and potentially in the midst of selling my short-term rental due to the significant demand decrease and the fact I don't want to deal with a tenant from out of state. This rental has done really well ($12-15K net profit) which result in $8K net positive cash flow. My question is I continue to do STR with it and have an NOI of about $5-7K a year but a net neutral or slightly net negative cash flow, should I consider selling it because of the negative cash flow? This essentially means I'm paying down some of the principal myself.

815,realestateinvesting,Gathering Thoughts,"I am exploring renting out our current SFH primary residence. We live in a low cost of living area.

Very confident based on comps that we can safely charge $2,000 a month in rent for it with the PITI being a tick under $1,400. It’s also in an A neighborhood. 

We already got approved up to 400k with 10% down for a new primary residence, but with interest rates high I’m not sure I want to pay PMI on top of a 6+% 30-year interest rate. I was told a 3/1 ARM by a local bank is at 5.2% interest with $420 in total closing costs and we can refinance to a fixed mortgage once rates subside. Wanted to get feedback on all of this and also any advice for a first-time real-estate investor. Thanks."

The insurance knocks about $100 per month off my initial cash flow projections which still has it cash flow around $275 per month after 8% vacancy, and conservative expenses.

Also, would you buy a property in a place where rental properties fill out like hot cakes, but the rent to price ratio is relatively low, or the demand is not as high, but you would get a better cashflow for the amount of money you invested (assuming that you were able to find tenants without any gap)."

Be mindful of the FHA self sufficiency test.  Failing to screen for this may potentially kill your deal and risk your earnest money.  I’ve seen deals blow up at the 1 yard line because LENDERS even forgot this test, which is a requirement per FHA.  FHA cannot close if this test is not met.

A good TL;DR for this test “Lenders can't waiver or make exceptions to the self sufficiency rule. This is a FHA lending requirement that has nothing to do with the lender. They will not take any other factors into account i.e. W2 income. All they are looking at is simply does 75% of rents cover 100% PITI and vacancy.”

While I'm here I want to ask something that's been bothering me.  I'm seeing all these rental listings on Zillow and Redfin in the areas in that we want to invest.  The rental price isn't great as in I don't know how the landlords are making money.  Multiple times, I see houses get sold and listed for rent immediately after for about $100 dollars for the estimated mortgage calculation.  The problem with these mortgage calculators from redfin or Zillow is that they assume insurance and tax to stay the same.  Is there a strategy that I'm missing?

I'm really not sure what to do as I'm very conflicted.  For 2023, we're projected to make 380k pre-tax if my consulting gig doesn't fluctuate.  Our average for the last few years was roughly about 450 to 550k.  We have about 500k in equity and 200k-ish in cash including our emergency fund.

I'm a pretty big guy, so it's not like I felt unsafe, but i just don't know how to feel about it. And i don't want to be that guy who says, ""Never touch me again"" loudly and make things weird. I did mention, your pretty strong for an old lady, you choked me pretty hard. And of course she played it off, saying how shes gentle. She is pretty flirty and makes jokes and comments, but I usually just brushed it off as her personality. She even says stuff, like I love you. I don't actually thinks shes a bad person. But her boundaries don't really seemed to be really aligned with mine.   


 I don't want to make things weird with my tenant, and it's not like she caused me any lasting pain, I think I was just being this big strong male, who was just being like, don't let it look like it bothers you, until it did, but by then, she let go.  And obviously it won't happen again, as I'll put a stop to it. I just figured She's an old southern lady and is very touchy/huggy which may be the case. But not sure how you guys would deal with this? Just let it go this time, unless it happens again, or should I say something?"

874,realestateinvesting,Real estate income,"I’m just curious and I’ll discuss this with my cpa tomorrow, but when I talk to investors they say they never pay taxes on their rental income.  I understand you get depreciation on the house over a certain amount of years and you get to write off things related to the property.  When they say this does it mean that they are basically negative for net?  Because I feel if you deducted everything down to $0 you’re basically never making money and the bank won’t consider you for loans on the business.  Please feel free to fill me in.  Thx"
875,realestateinvesting,How much emphasis do you put on Return on Equity?,"I'm curious what other investor's thoughts are on return on equity. I am about to move to a neighboring city and my plan for the last couple of years has been to convert my current house into an STR/MTR when I move. It's &lt;10mins from a major University and Hospital. Based on AirDNA and talking with other operators in the area I project it should net cash flow (ie after contingencies are budgeted for) roughly $1k/mo. When I purchased it I put $35k down and I refinanced during COVID and locked at 2.5% interest rate with about $300k principal remaining. $12k/yr cash flow, ~34% cash on cash return, ~$7k/yr equity pay down, plus appreciation in a very strong market.

The purpose of this post is not for help analyzing this deal or asking what should I do, but I was driving down the road the other day and the equity I have in the house came to mind. The house is worth ~$525k today, so I have about $225k in equity in the house. My return on equity each year is only 5.3%. 

How much thought do other investors put into return on equity? Do you guys revisit your portfolio every so often and determine what you should liquidate to have working harder in other assets?"
876,realestateinvesting,40% of Annual Appreciation occurs in these Two Months... - Research,"February and March. Actually, it is 120% - though we will get into that further down.

I would like to share with you some research I am conducting. The subject of this research piece is Seasonality, the fluctuations of a market in relation to the time of year. This data comes from the northern Front Range of Colorado, though any four-season locale may exhibit similar trends. 

Regardless of region, I hope everyone may find some value in the trends explored below. Buyers, Sellers, and Investors can all benefit from this kind of information. Short-term traders, such as Wholesalers and Flippers may find this particularly useful. 

The source data is from the past ten years, Median Sale Price of Single-Family Detached Residential between 1,000 SqFt and 4,000 SqFt, Monthly periodicity, starting from January 1st, 2013. I consider this product the truest reflection of overall market sentiment. More information on data and methodology at the bottom.

To avoid confusion, let me clarify three terms that will be used: Gain, Loss, and Change. If property gains $5k in January, $5k in February, and loses $15k in March, for the whole term: the Gain is $10k, the Loss is $15k, and the Change is ($5k).

\----------------------------------------------

Summer is commonly understood as 'peak season' for Real Estate, and Winter the corollary - in terms of transaction volume, competition, Buyer Demand, Listing Supply, and all related metrics. It certainly makes sense, though what does this really mean? What does the historical data say about this?

It turns out, nearly 100% of price Gain occurs from January to July. All of the appreciation for the year occurs in just the first half of the year. Not only does the second half of the year - from July to January - have no Gain, it actually has a substantial Loss. 1% for the Total Market, greater Loss for some local markets.

Figure 1.1. Price Change in Seas1 (Green - Jan 1st to July 1st) vs Seas2 (Blue - July 1st to Jan 1st)

All further charts pertain to the Total Market (entire MLS) within the aforementioned SFR criteria.

Breaking this down further, we see the Month-specific data. The Annual Median Price change for the past ten years in February and March were about 3%. That's $30,000 in two months on a $500k home.

Not only is the second half of the year close to 0% Gain, it consistently houses periods of depreciation.

  
https://imgur.com/f9e4iVK 

Figure 1.2.

What I find particularly fascinating is despite the common notion that Summer is 'peak season', the vast majority of appreciation actually occurs in the Late Winter/Early Spring. Not only is Summer weaker, but the two worst-performing months are August and September.

Let's move now toward the Subject Line of this post. The next chart looks at the % of Gain, Loss, and Change of individual months. That is, if Real Estate experienced $100k/$25k/$75k of Gain/Loss/Change over the year, how much has each month contributed to each metric over the past ten years, on average?  
   
https://imgur.com/6L42IWq 

Figure 2.1.

(Side Note: Average is in Blue, Median is in Green. Briefly, Average gives an idea of what change is reasonably expected over a large period of time. Median gives an idea of what change is highly probable from year to year. Without getting into STDEV and more expansive math, the difference between them is a proxy for volatility. If they are both 10%, you can expect to see numbers around 10% from year to year. August in the ""% of Loss"" chart, for example, is Median 0% and Average 10%. This indicates August does not regularly experience depreciation, though when it does, it is a substantial drop.)

40% of annual Gain over the past ten years occurs just in February and March, 50% including April, and 71% including June and July. 71% in five months.

   
https://imgur.com/UEUsTmQ 

Figure 2.2.

The trend continues clearly here. Worth noting as a statistical oddity is January, the only month to have a roughly equal chance of producing either a substantial Gain or a substantial Loss, showing no clear trend toward one or the other.

How often does each month end up posting either a Positive or a Negative return?

   
https://imgur.com/MLhHYcI 

Figure 3.1.

March has never posted a Negative return. The lowest return March has ever posted was 7.9% in 2017

   
https://imgur.com/Z64mjds 

Figure 3.2.

If the numbers from Figure 3.1. and 3.2. sum to below 10, it signifies some number of years with 0% return for that month.

September has never posted a Positive return. The only non-Negative return was in 2021, in which is posted a 0.0% return. The highest non-zero return September has ever posted was (.8%) in 2020.

   
https://imgur.com/i4DbVvc 

Figure 2.3.

Be wary, as the above chart is different from the others. All previous charts I would consider useful and functional, whereas this chart is merely intriguing. It would be long-winded and uninteresting to go into why, though the absurd second sentence of this post gets at the idea. Here you can see that January and February combine to form, on average for the past ten years, 120% of the Annual Median Price Change.

What I consider most compelling about this chart is the spread between Median and Average. While it is clear from the above charts that February and March outperform the following three months, this provides a more telling illustration. Such a dramatic spread indicates that when the Real Estate market experience periods of explosive appreciation, those periods most reliably occur during just those two months.

881,realestateinvesting,$325k HELOC - how I used it.,"Back in fall of 2021 I got a $325k HELOC through Penfed on a long term rental I owned that had substancial equity.

I used it to buy a STR in Florida. I got a 2nd home mortgage with a 2.99% rate and 10% down. I paid about $480k and got $13k from the seller for repairs that I put towards the closing costs.

The house is a 5 bedroom 3 bathroom colonial from 1925. Very beautiful house with large columns and a lot of curb appeal. The house needed a lot of work and I planned on spending about $50k to get it all fixed up.

I used the HELOC for everything, the downpayment, remaining closing costs, furniture, holding costs, and renovations. I ended up spending way more than I thought I would and it took way longer to get the house ready. In addition to flooring and  foundation fixes, I had to get the entire house replummed with a new sewer line and I spent months getting rid of a rat infestation.

This all added up to the tune of $200k on the HELOC. After it was finished, I locked the HELOC on a fixed rate loan at 6.25% for 20 years. The payment on the HELOC is about $1500 a month. The mortgage payment with taxes, insurance is about $2600.

I have a property manager who takes 16.5% a month and I have been averaging 20 nights a month for the past 4 months, since it started. My cut has been averaging about $5500 a month. The reviews have been good and I'm sitting at almost a 5 star rating.

I made so many mistakes and learned a lot. I had bad contractors, and I didn't oversee the project very well as I was busy with my life. In the end, it all worked out.

One thing this property has going for it is that it's much cheaper per person than a hotel. It's been poplular with family groups, business groups, bachelor parties, etc. My plan is to aggressively pay off the HELOC and buy another property. This deal has a COC return of infinity as it is 100% financed. I probably have about $70k in equity at this point. After the renovations were completed, it's been very passive, just an occasional text to let me know when things need to be replaced."

I'm interested in short-term rentals and I'm thinking of buying properties to rent out on AirBNB. I'm looking for a real estate software that can help me check the properties and I think AirDNA could be a good option.

However, I'm a bit intimidated by the financial numbers and I don't want them to slow me down. Can you recommend any software that can help me manage the financial aspects of my properties easily?

I don't want to use software like QuickBooks. I want to use something specific to short term rentals.

Here are the things I'd like to track:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Purchase price of the property
2. Down payment and financing terms
3. Monthly mortgage payment
4. Property taxes and insurance
5. Monthly maintenance and repairs costs
6. Monthly utilities (water, electricity, gas)
7. Monthly property management fees (if applicable)
8. Estimated rental income per month
9. Occupancy rate (the percentage of time the property is rented out)
10. Average daily rate (ADR) of similar rental properties in the area
11. Average length of stay by guests
12. Cleaning and turnover costs for each guest
13. Sales and occupancy taxes (depending on the location)
14. Furniture and amenities costs (if furnishing the property)
15. Capital expenditures for upgrades and repairs over time
16. Return on investment (ROI) and cash flow analysis.

Although whilst researching I found out they are volatile, I analyzed some REITS and found out they do not lose more than a few dollars off their stock price during fluctuations, with their biggest price cut being in 2020, during the covid 19 season.

I'm not sure I want to put a ton of work into the next property though - rather have simple fixes/cosmetics to generate higher rents.

912,realestateinvesting,Buy a house to mostly rent it out at Airbnb?," 

Hi!

So, I'm thinking about buying my first property. I live in Norway and have a steady income (not too much, but I do the best of it). Until now I've been saving in funds. The thing is that I don't know where I want to live the next years. Here, selling and buying a house is quite expensive, so you should live there for at least 5 years, except if the prices rise a lot.

So, I've been playing with the idea of buying a house I would like in the long time as a holiday home. I found a house in a place that's quite popular for tourists - Lofoten. It's well within my budget. I would need to fix it up a little bit to make it nicer, but I want a project so that's okay. It's very popular for Airbnb there and I think it's possible to rent it out for the whole summer on short-rentals. If not, there's a shortage of houses for the locals, so long time-renting wouldn't be a issue I think.

If so it would look like this this year:

* go up in june, spend about a month fixing up the house and making it appropriate for renting out.
* rent it out on airbnb in july and august (probably living in my car or tenting)
* live in the house out the year, and until spring, maybe some short time rentals if there's any interest (while working from home). Maybe fix up some more if necessary.
* Then maybe I'd try to find some long time rentals or see how much it's possible to rent it out for a short time.

(I DON'T need to live in my car to fund the mortgage, but it's a nice time of the year to do so anyways and would make it possible to rent out the whole house). If I price the house CHEAP compared to other houses in the area, I'd have to rent it out for ten days a month to cover my mortgage+electricity+internet etc. Or just rent out a room long term.

I don't think I'd live in the house for many years (for now it's way too big for me), but I think I'd like to keep it as an extra income, and also have it available if I'd like to go there for vacation.

But, I don't know if this would be stupid? It's either this or keep investing in funds."

Should I break everything down between our rentals, our property management for other landlords, and our brokerage side?
What questions will be asked? 
Are there any off the wall questions that I should prepare for?

Any insights would be great.

936,realestateinvesting,[Analyzing first deal] Paying for utilities is killing my cashflow,"I've entered escrow on a multi-family property in my home town. The property was built in the 60's, but has been well taken care of. No major renovations since then (wooden paneling, poor interior lighting, brown carpet, cheap ceiling tiles).

The income looks pretty good on paper, but I found out the current **landlord pays for all the utilities.** With that, the numbers look a lot less appealing. Most tenants are older, low income, and a few have lived there for 10+ years. However, they're quiet, pay on time, and take care of the property. I'm hesitant to hike up the rents and potentially displace them. Looking for advice to improve cashflow.

|Price:|$400,000|
|:-|:-|
|Loan:|20% down @ 7.5 interest|
|Units:|9 units (5-plex and 4 mobile homes)|
|Sqft:|550-800sqft  each|

|Annual income:|$60,000 ($500-600 per unit)|
|Annual utilities:|$18,900|
|Insurance, property taxes, vacancy (5%), management (8%), misc.|$13,900|
|**Total expenses:**|$**32,805**|

**Opportunities to get this cash flowing**

* Increase rents by $50 to offset utilities (+5400 income)
* Renovate two already empty units and increase rent by $100 each -- budget $25k total (+2400 income)
* Purchase and rent two new mobile homes -- budget $15k each including installation -- rent for $750 (+18,000 income)
* Increase rents as tenants move out.
* Add card operated laundry mat with 2 washer/dryers (+1200 income)

**Questions**

Realistically, the average rent needs to be around $700/unit or tenants need to pay the majority of their utilities for this to cashflow at 20% down.

* Am I being too cheap with only 20% down or is this simply a bad deal?
* Is it reasonable to increase rents on low income housing by $100-150? It makes sense from an investment perspective, but it feels wrong.
* From your experience, is $10-15k enough to replace carpet, replace wood paneling with drywall, and update bathrooms for 500-700-ish sqft?"

938,realestateinvesting,"Combining two households in Texas, looking for ideas on how to properly take advantage? Sell, rent, etc.","My fiancee and I are moving in together. I'm selling my house and we are moving into hers, since we don't live in the same city at the moment. I am wondering how to best take advantage of our situation.

&amp;#x200B;

My house (DFW):

Market Value: \~250k

Mortgage Owed: \~97k

Mortgage Payment: $1300/month

Interest Rate: 3.5%

Estimated Monthly Rent: $1800-$2000/month

Tax Rate: 2.5%

&amp;#x200B;

Her House (Houston):

Market Value: \~400k

Mortgage Owed: \~200k

Mortgage Payment: $1500-2000/month

Interest Rate: 0%

Estimated Monthly Rent: $2700-$2900/month

Tax Rate: 2.5%

&amp;#x200B;

We would like to get a new house together, ideally in the next 3-4 years, but it's tough selling a house that has a 0% interest rate (which we would not be able to get again). Thinking maybe we could rent it since the entire profit would go against the principle. I'm leaning towards renting my house as well since it's 3.5%. I'm just looking for ideas of how to best take advantage of this situation since the rates are currently \~6.5%. The equity in these houses would also be our down payment for a new house, roughly in the $400-500k range. I would also want to use a property manager.. I don't really have a desire to be a landlord and would be looking for purely passive income, although I wouldn't mind potentially building up a network of houses to start obtaining a larger and larger cash flow. Another idea would be to stay in the 0% interest house, pay the minimum mortgage, and use our income to start building down payments for building a network of houses. Current combined household income is \~$215k.

940,realestateinvesting,Might buy a foreclosed home. Advice please.,"OK, so I might buy a foreclosed home. It's a doozy of a situation that I do not have experience in. But, I am intrigued, because this quaint home, with a bit of tender loving care, would be worth much more than it is listed. 

The doozy part is, the old homeowner still resides in it, is confrontational, says he's unwilling to leave. But, I didn't cast judgement on him when I met him and we actually found some common ground. It sounds like he would rather it go to me then someone who's going to bulldoze it on acquisition day.  


It it small. But has hardwood floors, solid foundation, no mold, and is habitable. Because of the situation I can get it pretty cheap. Then was hoping live in it and do renovations for around 6 months. Then turn it into a rental. I am handy at most repairs and am an electrician.

It's tantalizing me because it's listed only $190k. The lot is basically worth that so it's almost like a free house if I can deal with the Homeowner amicably.   


My concerns are buying the home and the previous homeowner burning the house down or cutting water pipes before I can get house insurance. I don't even know if I could get house insurance in this type of situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like he would leave amicably. I understand the foreclosure process if he doesn't. But, I don't know what recourse I would have if he destroys the home during the eviction process.

946,realestateinvesting,Looking to rent starter home - what is my math missing?,"Spouse and I are interested in keeping our starter home to rent after we upgrade. It is a duplex(1 attached wall between 2 homes). We own one side - 3bd/soon to be 2full bath.

My current mortgage + property Tax is $1250/mo(locked in at a 3.125% interest rate). 

Comparable rentals are going for  $2200/mo. This is assured as there's 2-3 streets of almost identical units renting for this much. We are within 3 blocks of a major university and a re-developed downtown(Whole Foods within a 5 minute walk).

I know once we change our primary residence, we'll be kicked out of our homestead exemption, but even so, I'm taking 2200-1250 = $950. Setting aside 40% of $950 for maintenance/taxes, that's $570/mo, $6,840 profit annually. 

The foundation is rock-solid, the roof is slate. Major plumbing is being upgraded this year(original pipes, adding a bathroom). We can handle many repairs ourselves. We're comfortable screening tenants and since it's only 1 property that we'd be at most 30 minutes from, we're not interested in hiring a PM.

We are being FUD'd by family to sell just to have more down-payment for our second home, but we were thinking of using a HELOC to help cover that down payment(if needed but we're not planning to need to do so). 

What are my numbers missing? Is the current mortgage too high vs the rent to be worth it? I know selling it at some point would generate a nice chunk of change, but we're both wanting to try to hang out to this, purely for the location, as long as we can."

I’m located in Charlotte, NC and in 2020 I purchased a home where I lived in the community for 28 months. I recently purchased another home and decided to turn the previous one into a rental.

The community has spoken about there being issues with some members who are mainly renters (speeding, unkept lawns, nuisance/late night loudness etc.)

The community decided that a solution would be to:

- Place a rental cap of 10% at any given time
- Restrictions do not apply to the HOA for any unit owned by he HOA.
- You must live in the home for 18 months prior to renting it out
- Can only purchase a home in the community as an owner with the intention of living i.e keep out big companies turning everything into a rental
- All leases need to be approved by the HOA board
- Clause that says you can only rent to families, couples, and individuals. More specifically: “All homes that are leased pursuant to the requirements of this section, may only be leased to single families, couples, or individuals. Under no circumstances, may any home be leased to more than two-persons unrelated by marriage or blood.” (I’m not sure if this is borderline illegal or against fair housing?)

They will be voting on this in late March. It will most likely pass.

This puts me in a predicament. I had intended to include lawn maintenance in my lease so as to appease the community and do my best to rent to responsible people of course.

But now I am not sure how to proceed, essentially being forced to sell this home that I have a &lt; 3% interest rate on since I no longer live there or keep it empty until my number is called on a waitlist. 

How should I proceed or what is the best way to approach a situation like this?

I know, HOAs are awful, but I jumped into this home as a primary."

I am looking to get into flipping houses, but by using my VA loan benefit. My current plan as follows.

Buy a house that needs renovations, but still livable, which is a stipulation of the VA loan. While living in the house for a year, another stipulation of the VA loan, I will do the renovations. 

One question that I had is it possible to take out an additional short term business loan or some other type of loan, that I can put money down for in order to secure it, for a year to 18 months to fund the cost of renovations?

For over simplified math's example

$200k purchase price, 0 money down due to VA loan, 5% closing cost, total upfront cost: $10,000 

$100k renovation cost, funded by a loan to include loan principle and interest, down payment: $20,000

Total cost of house: $300k

Total cost out of Pocket: $30k

Sell price: $350,000

Price difference between total house cost and sell price: $50K

Profit: 20k.

Use a 1031 exchange and start the process all over again. 

Obviously I would need to find properties that meet certain criteria to make the finances make sense such as initial purchase price vs projected sell price vs renovations needed.  But is there anything else I am missing? Can I even get a loan for renovations with a down payment? Any help would be much appreciated."

We were under contract to sell our mobile home park portfolio last year this time, and the buyer tried to retrade at a $3mm lower purchase price. We declined that offer. Lol. Iirc, we were at about a 4.8 cap, so really damn good. No expectation it’s anywhere close to that anymore unfortunately.

Anyway, we are thinking of selling a couple of our parks rather than the whole portfolio this time. Going to start reaching out to a couple of brokers we know, but figured I’d post up considering it’s a slow Sunday night."

985,realestateinvesting,Tax Deed Auctions,"From what I understand, after I buy the property at auction, I get a tax deed 6-8 weeks later confirming my ownership of the property, but the original owner has up to a year to file a claim against the county to reverse the sale, so I should pretty much just sit on the property for a year and put minimal investment into it beyond permitting and weed control it seems like... I understand the chance of someone filing a claim and winning in court to invalidate the sale is very slim, but I am in California and CA isn't known for rational judicial decisions and there is no way to know that the county checked all the boxes, but I assume they did. Am I being irrational? Is that really a possibility at all? Anyone knowledgeable about tax deed auctions? I'm getting the title report delivered this week as well to make sure there won't be any liens that won't be wiped out by the auction. All I know is what I've researched, I lack experience with this. I have been unable to get in contact with the owner, they seem to have left the country and their name is essentially John Smith, so I can't buy it direct, hoping everyone else comes up short in that regard too.  


Is there anything else I should look out for or be aware of.

990,realestateinvesting,I'm Learning a Hard Lesson in Real Estate Investing,"The lesson is: don't give a deep discount on rent to your friends or family. We have a friend who needed a place to live, and we decided he could live in our apartment (which is a walk-out unit in our primary residence). It's a pretty nice space: studio, with kitchenette, washer/dryer, about 1,000 square feet. Full-size garden level windows. I reckon market rent is about $1500. We decided to rent to them for only $800/month. Rent includes all utilities.

Now, I happen to know how much this person earns, and so market rent was probably never in the budget for them. Turns out, the goodness of my heart has started to sour a bit. It's not that they're a bad tenant (they're not), it's just that I've realized I'm severely subsidizing the space out of my own pocket. Over the last year natural gas price has doubled (and our walls don't have insulation), home owners insurance is up 25% (wildfire area), and other costs have risen too. While I wanted to give this person a head start in life and a chance to save up a down payment for a home of their own, it's not like they're my own child or something. Resentment is starting to creep in. I recently raised the rent to $950, but we're still nowhere near market.

TL;DR don't under-rent to friends or family. Either the landlord will become resentful, or the tenant will become frustrated by a lack of landlord attention (or both)."

My question is this. If he figured it out. Could he represent himself and sell his home himself? Could I offer him money for his home privately? Or once it is in the court system he has no control. My guess is that it's the ladder.

As title states, I’m considering purchasing an investment property this year and, separately, my sibling is looking to purchase their first home. For context, I just purchased a home last year that is my primary residence. Also for context, this is at the idea stage - I haven’t spoken with my sibling about this yet.

I’m trying to identify the risks in combining forces with a sibling, our financial situations are different but they are incredibly handy and responsible. I think worst case scenario would be that they lose their job due to some unforeseen company layoff and can’t get a new one quickly. In this scenario, I’d be on the hook for the mortgage if they ran through their emergency savings. Also, I’m making a big assumption that we come to a fair model of how to split financial responsibilities for this situation, we haven’t discussed this yet.

On the positive side they would be able to manage the property and I think it would be a benefit for both of us and possibly lead to doing more multi-family units together.

Positive or negative, what other considerations are there?"

But having had no experience in being a landlord or even buying a house, this seems like a daunting task. I pay attention to bigger pockets and am learning on there as much as I can. I feel going straight for a large multifamily will hurt me more than teach me. I was looking at house hacking in an SFH or even buying a duplex As a starter multifamily. But I hear that house hacking in a duplex pretty much negates any cashflow since you're paying half the mortgage. So I guess my question is, what kinds of properties should a newbie taking baby steps look at? How can I build my knowledge about real estate investing enough that I'll feel like I should actually jump in and buy a property? 

Another thought on the duplex: if I bought one and house hacked, I'd be losing money. But if the equity appreciated and I could HELOC and buy another duplex. Rent out the room i was staying in so i could start to cash flow. That would be a good strategy right? It seems more like a gamble on the market. Just trying to get ideas on where to start."

Bought  off market with business partner in July 2022 (also GC) to run as an air bnb. Used hard money for the purchase and reno

The house was WAYYYY more messed up than originally anticipated and cost significantly more to get up to speed. 

Purchase $375k

Reno/furnishing - $110k

House if it was to sell would be about $500k-$525 (with closing costs and utilities we would take a small loss) - listed it for $575k just to see

Issue is that the 2 air bnb management companies we were going to use initially gave us projections around $100-120k a year and now its $60-70k

monthly payment will be $4200 (with insurance and assessed taxes) - annual it would rent for $4000 (2 units a 2/1 and separate 1/1) 

Home is a much older house (100 years, good style but we had a lot of termite damage in it - it has since been tented, trenched, treated and a bond put on it)

My business partner wants to sell, take a loss and put his money back to use in something else - I dont mind doing that but wanted to see if there were some other options.

We had an interested party who offered $575k but after an inspection (they said they sent the inspector home after 20min) they cancelled as they said there was so much termite damage that the roof was about to fall in. They then sent the pictures of some of the support beams - I believe it is ""worm wood"" and they thought it was termite damage but I explained it was the style and not the house falling down

1033,realestateinvesting,Have 10 Rental Properties Owned Free &amp; Clear - Need to Learn About Accessing Credit," Hi,

I have about $750k in rental properties with no debt on them. I built the portfolio using cash and loans outside the banking system, so I don't have any experience with accessing credit for real estate, other than the mortgages I've taken out on my personal home. I'm also in the process of creating an LLC for these properties, primarily for estate planning purposes.   
I have plenty of cash on hand for repairs and cap-ex, but I will have opportunities in the near future to purchase additional properties from a family trust as siblings decide they'd rather have the cash than a steady stream of rents. Needless to say, buying them with no financing will be difficult to do.   
I am very conservative when it comes to debt. We have only the mortgage on our primary right now. However, I need to learn more about my options for accessing credit to be ready to purchase these properties in the future. I'd prefer secured loans against my rental properties for the lower interest rates, but I'd rather not take out a mortgage on the newly purchased properties individually if I can help it.   
Is there something like a secured commercial revolving line of credit I can open to purchase these properties with cash, then pay down using rents from all the properties? I'd open it in the LLCs name, but I'm sure I'd have to be personally liable as well for the loan.  
I'm open to other options as well, and really just trying to learn the most I can before making a decision. Not looking to be maximally leveraged or try some exotic financing strategy to turn $750k into $10m in the next five years :)

1036,realestateinvesting,Remodel mobile home and rent out or demo/sell and build,"My mother recently decided to give my sister and I part of our inheritance early. It's not a lot, but my mother worked hard to save what she could. We each received a little less than an acre in western Arkansas. My part has the double wide manufactured home in which I live with my wife and kids, my sister's land is adjacent and has our grandparents old house on it. That house is fit only for demolition. I recently got a great new sales job with projected income between $150k and $225k per year, giving me the disposable income to try out some investment ideas I've had. 

My quandary is this: what to do with the mobile home. I have no intention of selling the land, but I do not wish to live there any longer. The mobile home needs serious rehabilitation: leveled, new HVAC, roof, siding, etc. My options as I see them are to remodel the mobile and rent it out, sell it as is, or demo it. It has sentimental value, so the first option has its appeal, and I have someone in mind for a renter. A friend's daughter and her family have had a rough go of late, and helping them get out of their current situation would be a bit of ""paying it forward"", which is important to me.  Unfortunately, it will likely cost $40-$50k for a basic remodel, eating a large portion of my disposable cash for the year and taking about 7 years to recoup my investment. If I sell it as is I might get $6000 for it, giving me a bit of extra cash to put towards other investment ideas I have (like a 30+ acres tract of undeveloped land an hour from Walmart corporate headquarters). If I decide to demo it the local volunteer fire department would likely be happy to use it as an exercise, allowing me to minimize that cost.

1045,realestateinvesting,question on purchasing professional office building,"So I'm a young attorney. I have been practicing about 4 years. So here is the back story with my office building. 

My law partner owns a 1/2 interest and the newly appointed judge owns a 1/2 interest. The judge owning real estate with another attorney is a conflict of interest so he needs to sell. My law partner is 63 and wants to retire and selling the building to me on a contract is part of his retirement plan. 

My law partner owns his 1/2 interest outright and is willing to sell to me while taking a second position to the bank if I buy the other half interest. Which would mean I wouldn't have to come up with any money up front or leverage my primary residence. 

The first issue I have is I currently pay my law partner $750 a month rent. The judge rents his to another business for $700 a month. (Just fyi the building is two stories that are identical so it's just been the practice myself and my law partner on the first floor and the judge rented the second floor and kept the rent.) My law practice is good and I can afford the increase in payment. 

My payment for the entirety will be about $2,500/month. The building is worth about 300k. 

Is it wise to buy a commercial property that doesn't necessarily cash flow even if I'm using it and would plan to use it as a wealth creating opportunity? (The thing that sucks is had I had this opportunity last year the thing almost cashflows off the one renter and I would have had free office space) 

Other question. The judge originally had thought he wanted about 120k to 140k for his half. He hires a shitty realtor who does a market analysis and uses properties from 150 miles away as his comp properties and now he wants 190k for his half. My law partner wants 135k for his half.

Our home and llc are 100% in my wifes name. The hvac company is an llc taxed as an scorp, its my 4th year in business, i had 69k of taxable income in the business that rolled onto our taxes for 2022 and im trying to find somewhere to put that in 2023 because it will probably twice that. This seems like a perfect opportunity. A couple options for this purchase ive considered, but there are so many moving parts and pros/cons to consider of each scenario…Any advise would be greatly appreciated. I do have an accountant to ask and i will, but its tax season. 

My options i considered. 
Create seperate llc for new property 
-or-
Buy house in my personal name. Our primary home is 100% in my wifes name, i know we cant have 2 primaries. So either way it would be treated as investment property.
 -and-
Lease lower level (unfinished basement with garage) to my hvac business (i currently lease storage anyways and could use that instead with the advantage of it being across the street from my home business) and short term rental the second level living area. 
-or-
Renovate as complete home and rent or sell.

If kept in personal name, would i retain the capital gains break even if its an investment property?

1051,realestateinvesting,Should my father (57M) and I (23F) invest in a property that might leave us broke?,"So, to give some context, I currently live with my father in a 4 bedroom 2.5 bathroom house that has actually allowed him to begin to save money, which is something he hasn't been able to do in a long time. Since my grandfather passed away, he got a decent inheritance that would allow him to put a down payment on a house that's closer to our main town. We currently both drive approximately 30-40 mins to work one way, and found a house that is only 12 minutes away from town. However, he has been back and forth on if he should sell our current house and put the money from the sale towards the new house, or if he should find a renter for our current house so we can live in the house closer to town but still have ownership of our current house. The house we're interested in is currently being built, though, we would lose a LOT of backyard, and since we have two medium-sized dogs, we're not sure if going from .5 an acre of the backyard to approximately 400sqft of backyard. We also lose space in the house, though, I am actually fine with this, since there are only 3 of us in the house.
On another note, the house were living in is in a mountain community, and he always calls it his ""sanctuary."" He has been back and forth on if he should sell or try to rent our current house out, or just give up on the new house that's being built currently. He says he wants to get this house mainly for me, but I know he loves it up here, and the only annoying thing about our house is that it has some issues along with the drive being far from town. Additionally, like I mentioned, I don't want my dogs to lose a lot of their yard, and he would have absolutely no savings left from the down payment on the new house if her were to go through with it. If he sold this house, he could use the money from the sale on the new house, as I mentioned..but I don't think he wants to let it go.. So, based on this information, what do you believe we should do? We're both very torn on what to do, currently, and have already put some money into customizing the new house. What would you do?
Any information would be quite helpful and insightful, so thank you in advance."

1063,realestateinvesting,What makes real estate investing superior to investing in index funds like S&amp;P500?,"I’m working on my 5 year plan. Currently that plan consists of getting as much money as possible and buying units out in a new state that’s warmer, landlord friendlier and has a better chance of appreciation. 

I want to buy enough units out there to be producing at least $5,000 a month in cash flow, and from there build further savings, diversify investments, build wealth by investing further into business and such. 

I saw a comment on a stock subreddit and everyone was jerking each other off in agreement that it’s a better and easier return to just buy SPY. 

Why do you guys agree or disagree with that perspective. 

My personal reason I was planning to buy property is because it’s a physical thing that’s highly in demand and will likely stay that way for a foreseeable future. 

I’ve spent some time investing in stocks and I feel it’s more like a casino than an investment. Markets are heavily manipulated and I don’t feel I trust large amounts of money in there if it’s constantly dealing with manipulation or 10 year crashes. 

I understand real estate can crash too just like a stock chart, but my perspective is that any crash faced by real estate if at all would simply be a huge investment opportunity. 

Where as SPY could go left right up or down for years and years on end and “analysts” will easily explain it away with narratives by the newspapers they own and personally influence. 

But I’m second guessing myself after that comment. I own one triplex and I’m now aware of the randomness of expenses and the work that goes into it. It’s profitable work but it’s work nevertheless. 

Would just putting money into SPY be a stronger and easier return?"

1065,realestateinvesting,"Buying a house in a Corporation (Either LLC, S/C corp etc)","Hi All,

I'm curious if I can do this **legally** and not have issues with the IRS.

**What I want to do:**

I would like to buy a house with a corporation, and then rent it out to myself for super cheap, say for example $100/mo. The Corp would be paying for all the maintenance on the house, property taxes etc.

**Why I want to do this:**

As I sure a lot of people will ask why, and what the point or benefit is, so I'll address that up front. Because I am an entrepreneur, I don't have a normal W2 job. If a W2 employee wants to buy a house for 1 Million, he can't just make a million, as the money gets taxed (So you have maybe 650-700k left).

However, if your company makes 1 million and you spend it before calendar year ends, you have no taxes as you have made no money. So essentially, you save at least 30-35% on the purchase price (depending on your personal tax bracket) when buying the home. Furthermore, you save the same when you buy stuff for the house, a new fridge or windows etc.

**My questions:**

1. Are there any laws that states you must rent at ""fair market value"", so in other words, if the rent for that house would normally be $4000/mo, can I rent it out to myself for $100/mo? (Mostly interested in California laws)
2. Can I have the company pay for all the maintenance and expenses? Property taxes, new fridge etc.
3. Can I or the company get in any trouble with the IRS for this?

**Alternatively:**

The other alternative, in case the way above isn't great, could be that my company loans me the money? I don't know if you can borrow money from your own corporation as you would a bank, but then again you just pay back ultra low monthly mortgage of for example $100 etc? (however, this way I would personally have to pay property taxes, maintenance etc)

Thanks everyone for your help and advice!"

I don't like the kitchen tile and I don't feel like paying a lot to redo the tile and I also have to rip out 3 carpets from the 3 bedrooms so I figured I would just put LVP down and use a rubber underlayment to help with the foot steps and absorb the sound.

1070,realestateinvesting,Thoughts on my closing costs and mortgage rate,"I was just preapproved for a 170K loan) assuming a 200K property) at a 7.875% rate (conventional 30-year fixed), which I think is high given current rates. Credit scores are 800+ and the loan is for a 3rd additional property. That rate is also based on buying down 3 points (I was told that given the current rate environment, I must buy down points for an investment property).

Besides the rate and points, the estimated closing costs excluding prepaid reserves and interest prepayment total $6,300. For context, I had purchased a $500K+ property ($400K conventional loan at 3%) summer of 2021 and paid roughly this same amount. I’d expect that the costs would be lower given the lower loan amount.

I have 50k in my TFSA Split into 3 dividend stocks. 12k, 17k, 21k. 

Option 1.

I have a total of 50k in my TFSA. I can pull 15k for my closing, and 25k for the HST, and borrow 28k from the HELOC. I would pay  interest on the 28k until I get the HST rental rebate. I would have approx 10k left in my TFSA.

Option 2

Pull 15k from my TFSA for closing. Borrow 54k from the HELOC. 

Option 3 

same as option 1 , except pull everything from my TFSA and borrow 18k from my HELOC. I will pay interest on the 18k until I get the HST rebate.  Once I get the HST rental rebate put the approx 10k back into the TFSA.

The two options I was considering for the upcoming year were

1. Get a home equity loan for ~$40k-$50k for a down payment on a new house and rent out our current house to cover the mortgage+loan+property manager(I don't want to be a landlord), on it and just break even for the time being. 

2. Sell the house now for ~$175k-$200k profit and then put down 20% on our next house.


If I sell and take the $200k and put it in the market and average 8% I'll get $550k in 20 years. 

If I keep the house and rent it for 0 profit for 20 years and appreciates 3% for 20 years I'm looking at $1.1m with just having to cover the cost of repairs and the possibility of not having a tenant? 

We can dial back on our monthly retirement contributions, currently 33% of gross pay, to offset the lack of cash flow since this will essentially become part of our retirement portfolio.

My grandpa has added them to the deed but always stayed on himself. Now my grandpa and I are extremely close and he doesn’t want anything to do with it and was going to “let it rot”. But, I know this is a liability and regardless of the condition of the house it can be sold as either a house or as a plot. So, I told him to transfer me the deed and I would take care of it for him.

We live in Texas and I’m in college and work so I’m very busy. The house looks like garbage from the outside, the police who knew my dad well said he had an affinity for dumpster diving and he had. Shit. Everywhere. We didn’t go in the house because frankly we were all afraid of what we would see, but from the outside there was piles of trash and discarded junk, he tried to paint half of the house bright blue and there was 1/2 of all windows broken out. 

There is also two live in crackheads and a pittbull who I’m told by the police and neighbors have been taking advantage of my dad for months, we brought the police to the house and told them to vacate and put up no trespassing signs to get it on paper that they are not allowed there. Although we won’t be around to enforce it, it’s mostly for liability and so they can’t try to gain squatters rights. The neighbors hate those people (they loved my dad) and said they would be happy to call if they see them over there.

After all that, we left home to Texas and I called the electric company that the police told me would power that house to get the utilities turned off in order to give the people more incentive to leave. I wasn’t sure if they have been paying the bill or if my dad got assistance and had the lights turned on. Turns out, there should not be and has not been electricity to the house (legally) for a very long time. The lights were on when I went there. So, they probably tampered with it and rigged it up. Which I’m now responsible for. The company is going to investigate soon and I will get more information about that.

Basically, I need this house out of my hands. I’m far away, terrified of the house, and don’t have much information on it because my grandpa is grieving and also old and forgetful.  I am only 20 and although I want to go into real estate after college, I don’t know much about it, my aunt who’s an agent in TX is helping what she can and says I need to sell it as is to an investor.

I don’t know the square footage of the house, or what the inside condition is like, plus it looks like shit and there’s hundreds of pounds of trash outside. 

There is a lien on it for 10k from 15yrs ago and the house has been homesteaded so no property tax. Any advice is welcome I am just looking for some help or encouragement.

1107,realestateinvesting,Taking a cash-out refi and then seller financing to tenant (trusted friend),"I have some good friends renting a house from me.   We have a verbal rent to own agreement.  They pay on time, they take excellent care of the place (they worked for me on this and other rentals)  We've become very close.   
THere is about $50K in equity I'd like to have now.   It might be a while before they can get a mortgage.   


So, if i borrowed that equity and just let them take  over payments and kept it in my name what are the  implications?   


\---  right here is where ya'll tell me i'm a fool, but we are not having that conversation.   


So let's assume this plan works.  I take my   equity as a loan, they make the payments  I don't  claim  it as a rental on my taxes,   We have some written contract that  the house is theirs etc.   


I probably will not outlive a 30 year mortgage,  we would include our respective heirs in this deal (their young adult children are also good friends)   


At any time they could get their own financing and take over the note, i would make no claim to future gains in equity.   


If their lives fall apart and they stop making payments  then i'll deal with it.  But I'll have a nice chunk of cash to carry us through the problem.    


I'm retired, i have everything i need and stable pension.  I can afford for this to go  terribly wrong-  default, foreclosure, etc.   


So what are the problems I'm not seeing ?"

1113,realestateinvesting,is now the time for me to invest?,"quick background: husband gets tax exempt pension. i do not have a w2 job, but i own 2 llc's - one is a side gig renting out baby gear to tourists (i live in myrtle beach), the other is where i parked our two str condotel units until i sold them last year for a good chunk of profit since they were not performing well. before you even get on me about it, yes i know how fortunate we are that my husband's income sustains us. eventually i will go back to work at least part time.. my son will be in kinder soon. anyways.. 

we want to invest in a single family ltr but the current mortgage rates combined with the property taxes (my county reassesses upon sale and is higher for investment properties than primary homes) plus what i could realistically get for rent makes the final profit pretty much zero. unless i slap down like $100k+ which i really don't want to do. i'd rather just put 20-30% down and keep more cash on hand. 

if we had normal w2 jobs that we get taxes taken out for.. i'd be all about it right? use rental property deductions to lower agi. but, we don't.

1.470 sq ft duplex each 2 bed 1 bath. About 4 blocks from a huge university in a decent neighborhood. Built in 1939 and needs a lot of work 

All cash offer (source of fund is family loan at 5% for 1 year. Will refinance at that time.)
Offer: $340k
Earnest: $8500
Renovations (est.): $50k
ARV: $470-520k

Down payment of $50k

Estimated rental income: $3000 per month

1116,realestateinvesting,Challenging Foreclosure Validity Court Case Question (MA),"I am the owner of a house in western Massachusetts's that I purchased from the bank at an auction. The bank foreclosed on the previous owners and sold the house to me with them still occupying it. After offering cash for keys they informed us that they would be challenging the validity of the foreclosure based on 203.604 (face to face contact). Moving forward, after patiently waiting over 18 months the previous owners lost their case in civil court. Now, they are appealing it to superior court. My attorney is just advising me to wait it out. However, I am at a point where I am willing to do whatever I can legally to get them out.  Does anyone have any creative ways to assist in getting them to leave.

Also, about one year in to the civil case the judge ordered them to pay occupancy fee which is better than nothing but no where near what it should be. With the civil judges ruling what are my rights as the owner? Are they currently tenants, occupants, squatters? I am a little lost with where I stand and what my current rights are. If possible I have no problem walking into the house and becoming their new roommate. I will do whatever is financially smart and legally acceptable. I don't have the best relationship with my attorney (Not bad but just not someone who I feel is fully there for me) and she is expensive. My hopes is to get some seasoned investors input on savvy ways they have dealt or would deal with this. They are making my life more difficult than it should be and I am not against reciprocating this as long as I am playing by the rules.

1125,realestateinvesting,Looking for some inspiration/experience/advice from another RE investor who started out with limited cash,"I really want to build a portfolio, but do have limited down money if I want to retain some cash for operations (repair, vacancy, etc).  

I'm great with numbers and run a company now- so I'm fairly confident looking at the numbers and when I do, it's hard to find something that cash flows with a smaller amount down (for example, doing a 4 unit with a 3.5% FHA loan) right now between property values, interest rates, PMI, etc. 

I firmly believe in listening to the numbers and that's exactly why I haven't bought yet. 

So I'm just wondering if anyone else started out with a small amount of capital and how you navigated those first few properties?

However, I purchased this condo as a primary residence and I knew it was not a good investment property since the rent only covers part of the costs and I’m in the red every month.

Purchased for: $534,000
Rent: $1821/month
Loss: $330

It’s already appreciated to about $560,000 value in today’s market, and last year a comparable unit that’s slightly larger sold for $630,000. 

I’m not flush with liquidity, so I’m debating if when the mortgage is up in 2025, if I sell and cut my losses, or if I just do a HELOC and buy another property?

I’m a beginner investor, and honestly feel like I made an impulsive, idiotic mistake. Any help appreciated!"
1129,realestateinvesting,My 2 to 4 properties.,"  

So I'd like to talk about what to do with 2 homes that I have right now. And another 2 homes that I’m due to inherit. I’m 47 and I have very little saved in retirement and it’s long overdue that I put some thought into what I’m going to do with these properties and my life leading up to retirement. Considering SS won’t be a thing when I get older.  

I’m currently living with my partner, but that may soon change. In that event, I don’t mind renting a place for 6 months or so. 

First up is my 2bed 1bath flat that I bought in Feb 2022. The kitchen and bathroom have been completely renovated. Right now I owe about 202k on it. My monthly repayments for it are 1274 per month. It’s currently rented out at $300 a week. \*Yes, I intended on increasing the rent.   

Number 2 is a house in Tampa Florida that I used to live in. I own it free and clear but it’s not rented out. Mainly because all my stuff is still inside and it’s pretty old and beat up. It was built in 1937 and hasn’t been updated since. I had a home inspection done recently and it’s pretty dire. Cost wise, repairing it is neck and neck with a knockdown and rebuild. If I knockdown, I can only replace it with a single dwelling. I should also mention the surrounding area is gentrifying. The block is 30’ by 180’ on a corner lot. 

Number 3 is the house next door to the aforementioned house which is in a similar condition. That’s where my mother lives currently and is also owned outright. That block is 50’ by 180’ If I knockdown and rebuild there, I’m allowed to have 3 dwellings. 

If we both knockdown and rebuild, we can put a total of 5 dwellings. 

And finally, I’ll be handed my parents old apartment in Brooklyn. Purchased in 1974 for $35,000.  That is also owned free and clear, but it’s in a Co-op. The co-op has decided that I can only rent that apartment for 3 out of 10 years. 

My mom has absolutely zero interest in anything real estate wise. She likes to live between House 3 and the apartment. Is not interested in renting or mortgages at all.

I've been thinking about purchasing a rental property for some time, just haven't pulled the trigger yet.  My sister currently owns a 2 bedroom SFH in NJ (near the Jersey Shore).  They've got a 2nd kid on the way and are looking to move into something bigger.  With the market being what it is, she's looking to avoid having to do a contingency offer if she finds a place.

This got the wheels turning in my head.  I've got around $240k in equity in my primary residence and considering pulling some out via HELOC or HELoan to put a down payment (have some savings I can tap to limit the amount i'd have to take out of the house) and buy her house from her.  We talked a bit and given the ability to bypass the RE agents, the closing costs go down significantly and we can probably come up with a price that makes sense for both of us.  House is in good condition, newer roof and HVAC, just some cosmetic things (new flooring/carpet, refinish cabinets, fresh paint, landscaping) because she has a couple of bigger dogs.

I may have to do rentback for a couple of months until she can find a house and close, which works for me.  Thinking about doing a summer of STR to see what the cash flow looks like over the warm months, since it's pretty close to the beach, and then decide on either staying with STR or look for a long term tenant.  Generally speaking rents in the area are at or above 1% on long term and can cover the mortgage &amp; heloc until I can pay it off and potentially go positive, depending on what the STR market does.

Taxes have increased from $3200 to $6400 because of massive equity increase and reassement by county since COVID, contested from $7200.

College kids were gone over the holidays, every pipe in the house froze.  Total cost for repairs, including upgrade to tank less water heater, $44k (low crawl space,  built in 1911, had to go through floors in each unit, nightmare).  Insurance covered $17k of that. Lesson learned, not dwelling on it, but now I know better how to have invoices written up.

Property manager quit in December due to family issues,  property is 2 hours away, haven't found another manager, so lots of back and forth throughout the plumbing issue. 

Insurance may be canceled or at least increase significantly,  due to age of the home, broker is having a hard time finding quotes.

Estimated current value, with new roof, swapped Old Dominion electrical boxes last year, new PVS throughout, new thankless heater, new floors and painting throughout, $280k, conservatively,  comps are about $310k. My rents are very under market, lots of room for increase,  just wasn't my focus before all the melt down.

It was my first property and I now have 6 other doors,  thinking to just let this go while I have the loss to claim to avoid too much tax burden.

1162,realestateinvesting,Why do we like to invest in real estate?,"I've had a few of my friends ask me why I like real estate and have been putting so much of my time towards it and figured there's a lot of other people who could benefit from hearing my thoughts!

To start, there's many different type of asset classes like single family (houses with a suite or two). Multifamily (5 suites or more, apartments etc). Mobile home parks, assisted living facilities, storage etc etc etc. For the sake of this, I'm only talking about multifamily investments.

One of the main reasons I first became interested was the cashflow it can provide. I don't come from a wealthy background, my dad was horrible with money and my mom had to do all the income producing because of it. I don't want to end up like that or have to struggle like she did and additionally once I'm set up in life, she will be too. With multifamily you have multiple streams of income coming from one place.

A good way to look at is a chair or table. If you have 4 legs and one gets kicked out it may still stand, but the slightest movement or inconvenience (Expense, vacancy etc) can put weight on the side with no leg and cause it to topple over. If you add a 5th leg, or 8 or 15 and you knock one or two or 5 out, you're still going to stand up and be supported.

If you have just a single family home with a suite or two, and you have a vacancy that's a 100% or 50% vacancy rate and can be crippling, fast!

Now multifamily assets will still appreciate, but they aren't valued the same as a residential single family house. Houses are typically valued off comps or comparable - what the houses on your street sold for. IE - They compare it to something similar to get a baseline.

With multifamily, the condition and quality of the building of course comes into play but it's valued based on it's income and cash flow. This is where the bottom line comes into play.  In a 6% CAP market, assuming 50% expenses if all your rents in a 10 unit building are 600 each, i's going to be worth $600,000. If you're able to increase all those rents by 25 the value of that property just went up to $625,000.

Depending your market and local laws this can be taken advantage of quite easily. Where I'm from we can't raise the annual rent more than 2.5% which would be roughly 15 annual increase. In other markets, you can raise it how ever much you want and take advantage of it by refinancing once you've upped these rents and went back to the bank with new numbers. I don't suggest going and raising all the rents by hundreds, you're going to get some pissed off tenants and more vacancies but this is just an example.

As I said, quality and condition play a part but if it has a lot of deferred maintenance, it'll be valued a bit less and if it's up to date might be a bit more etc. The key driving factor is income."

1164,realestateinvesting,Help! Undecided about selling or keeping it as a rental.," 

My family has grown, and we are ready to upgrade to a bigger home. A rental is an excellent asset to own, but I need to gain experience with it. Here are the numbers:

* Fair Market Value 430k
* House is 15 years old, and I have done some upgrades
* Mortgage Balance 145K at 2.85% interest rate, eight years left in the loan
* Current mortgage payment, including tax, interest, and insurance, $1,950
* Comparable rents around the area are $2,300
* The school district is pretty good

We are a single-income household, with a gross income of 195K, current savings of $170K, and 110K in a brokerage account, for a total of $280K available for a downpayment of the new house. Our only debt is a car payment of $720/per month.

My realtor friend told me that my house is too nice to be rented and that tenants will destroy it. But if I sell it, I have to pay a realtor a 5% commission and then if I buy a smaller rental in a different area I will have closing costs.

If I keep the house, I want to hire a property management company. I know this will eat any cash flow, but I won't have to deal with tenants and the paperwork. Most of the rental income will go to pay down the principal, and in 8 years the house will be a payoff.

My other idea is to pre-furnish the house and hire an STR property manager. STR can bring better margins but also go the other way around and be in a negative return pretty quickly. The positive is no evection risk, unlike long-term rental. (I live in California)

What would you do in my situation?"
1165,realestateinvesting,Family Succession,"I’m looking for advice on how to proceed with a family succession strategy.

My father owns roughly 6 acres of land that is split between commercial and residential use. It’s location is great, and currently occupied by our family business, several commercial lessors and several multifamily homes (we own). My father is looking to retire, and we are looking at potential exit opportunities. I don’t have much interest in continuing his business, which he understands, but do have a great interest in retaining the property itself. Realtors have estimated sale price in Mid/High single digit $mm range. 

What ways do you see as potential opportunities for me to take over this ownership? I have a career in a different field, so I do not need immediate income from this, and I’m happy to pass on the income to him for his retirement. I do not have liquidity for a huge down payment, would this remove possibility of bank financing, and only leave seller based financing?

1173,realestateinvesting,Investor deep in private loans and unable to repay,"Hello fellow investors! I am curious if anyone has been a part of an investment group/partnership of which you/they have been able to recover the investment.

A few years ago I was captivated by an individual that demonstrated a strong understanding of real estate and had social proof from his vast network of other real estate professionals. This person showed great selflessness and willingness to share his knowledge and be a point of resource to anyone who would give him the time of day. He was always cheerful and flaunting his success. He gained a lot of followers (investors).

This person held meetups to educate anyone open to learn about reaching financial freedom. He created avenues for new ""investors"" to get started. He taught them how to find deals, and if they could not find deals, he would graciously allow them to invest whatever money they had into his projects. He borrowed upward in the millions, approximately 2-4 million from my estimations.

Over the last five years, this person was unable to turn a profit, let alone break even, on a single project. However he continues to raise more capital from the never ending ambitious new investors he recruited, $25k, $50k, $200k from each at a time. To this day, he has paid back only a small fraction of his entire debt. 


Everyday he continues to live a happy and carefree life with many investors left feeling helpless. What is this considered? Is he a con? Are we fools? Is this a ponzi scam? Are we screwed? What can we do? What can we do to educate others to be aware and avoid something like this?"
1174,realestateinvesting,Pay cash for a new build or split up the down payment and buy two properties?,"I'm looking at getting a couple single family properties this year and have thought about just paying cash for one now but then also have considered maybe buying two of them and just putting half down on each. 

The only thing holding me back is interest rates. I also avoid dept so it's hard to think about going into dept again when I don't have to 

If I pay cash it's instant cash flow and zero debt but if I wait to pay cash for another property in a few years the value of that new build will be much higher than today so not sure what would be best. I want to avoid having debt but also want to not be kicking myself in a few years. 

I'm not really looking for the extra cash as I have my business that makes me enough money so it's more of just finding places to park some cash and real estate seems as my next step in investments. 

If you had the cash available would you buy one outright or split it up and use debt and leverage to get more properties now? 

Appreciate your help and any advice."

1194,realestateinvesting,Beware of Liquidity issues and non-regulated companies with fractional Real estate investing,"A friend of mine invested in fractional real estate, with a company they saw on TikTok, and now cannot get their money out of it. Be aware that fractional real estate investing can be bad if you cannot sell your stake or there is no secondary market. Also, many of these companies aren't regulated, which can lead to problems (like with FTX).  Do your due diligence before investing with any company. 

Fractional real estate investing can offer many benefits (diversification, the ability to invest in real estate with a lower upfront cost, etc.) but it can present liquidity issues, such as the lack of a secondary market. Many fractional real estate investments are illiquid, meaning they cannot be easily sold or traded and their lack of liquidity can make it difficult to exit positions or access their funds. Many fractional real estate investments have long holding periods, which also limit liquidity (bad if you need to access your funds for emergencies)

Also beware of fraud due to lack of oversight, without regulatory oversight, non-regulated companies can mismanage or misuse of investor funds like FTX did. After events like FTX, it's important to perform diligence around any company you use to invest. When investing in fractional real estate, make sure you can exit a position, and that they are regulated.

People invest in fractional real estate investing because it provides exposure to real estate and allows you to own a piece of a property and receive a portion of the rental income as dividends, as well as property appreciation when you sell your shares. BUT, if investing in fractional real estate make sure you can sell the shares on a secondary market, and that the company is regulated. Fintor is an example of a fractional real estate company that provides an exit option through its secondary market. They are also SEC-qualified and registered (investor accounts are encrypted and protected.) Also, because you are investing directly into a real estate asset, and through a company, there is protection in the event that Fintor were to ever go bankrupt. (Fintor also pre-screens and underwrites each property for its cash flow and growth potential, then directly buys the property, and oversees any necessary repairs and renovation. I use them.  **If you're going to invest in fractional real estate, just make sure you look for these things**"

1200,realestateinvesting,Sell and Invest or Hold Long Term?,"Hello, 

I'm currently renting out my former residence and am fast approaching the time limit to avoid capital gains on a potential sale. Our CPA is really pushing me to sell and invest the proceeds in the stock market. Unfortunately, since I've gotten married, I no longer qualify for many tax benefits as our shared income is over the limits. CPA advises that we will build more wealth with the average investment return than we will cash flowing AND/OR should we chose to sell and take advantage of the increased appreciation, we will be hit hard with capital gains. Our goal is to retire early enough to enjoy it (my dad passed away at 60), give our kids a good start in life and maybe own a vacation property down the road. Please let me know what you investors think. I've always thought the road to wealth was real property, but our CPA has me thinking. Let me know if I'm missing any details and I will add:

Townhouse in the Bay Area (Northern California)

Bought in 2017 for $340,000

Last unit in our complex sold for $430,000 a couple of months ago

Currently owe $279,000

Interest rate is 4.125%

We are renting below market rate at $2,278/month as we have really wonderful tenants who are taking great care of the property and we'd like to keep them. Similar units are renting for $2,500 to $2,700. Our cash flow is minimal now, but the idea is (was) long term appreciation and retiring with no mortgage on a hugely cash flowing property or gathering more equity and then 1031-ing it into a vacation property for family enjoyment and Airbnb-ing. 

Market is down a bit since the last sale, but I'm guessing we could sell for around $415,000 or so. That would net us about $136,000 minus any realtor fees. Our tenants have also been asking if we would sell to them directly (I have no idea if they would qualify, but potentially that would avoid realtor fees?). Even with realtor fees, we'd be investing about $110,000 with the proceeds (if that math is right. I was a Literature major).

This is going to be a long post, as it’s a strange story. I’m going to try and remain anonymous, please don’t dox me. 

Me: I live in the PNW and own a thriving e-commerce plant nursery. I live in a beautiful mountain town of 1,000 people ten minutes from a ski resort and a hugely popular national park entrance. I make enough to not need any initial cash return from this RE investment. 

The  Property &amp; Area: 
There are only 5 highways that transverse the mountains from east to west in Washington State. Of these, only 2 are interstates. Each of them has a ski resort at the top of them, but extremely rugged valleys make building cities extremely difficult. Hence, even with the ski resorts and national parks, all of these towns are small. They cannot grow larger unless municipal sewer systems are built, which is impossible in 3/5 of them because the valleys are to narrow to allow the correct buffer from the rivers. 

Last year the state announced it was going to put in a municipal sewer in the only mountain town that it is legally possible to do so for environmental laws. Being a local, I had heard from my friends at the county about this before it became news. 

We met and have become friends with a kooky rich guy who is a Partner at a huge PE firm focused on M&amp;A (more below on him) and he offered to invest however much money we thought would be best to buy up a portion of this town prior to the announcement of the municipal sewer system. 

I befriended an older couple who owned the largest mixed use commercially zoned property in town, 20 acres directly up against downtown. It’s an old historic NF Ranger Station. 3 commercial buildings, and 5 homes on it, between cute single family cabins up to a 12br bunkhouse. Half cleared, other half is Forest with a beautiful waterfall on our private land. 

Purchase Price:
$2.3MM
$750k down
7 Years of interest only at fixed 6% rate
Total amount due at end of 7 years

The Investor:
I was approached by him initially because he wanted to buy my e-commerce company. I told him no because the company cash flows very well and I want to continue to grow it before I sell it. It’s been 2 years since we met initially, and are now good friends, and we trust him a lot. 

The Problem:
We have been trying to decide what to do with the property. It barely brakes even running it as airbnb, and commercial leases. 

He wants me to put together a pitch on what to do next with it. 

My current thought is to demo the old decrepit buildings and put in 80 RV spots. A sport rents for $500 a month here, so good cash flow. We have the largest septic system in the town right now, and would not have to wait for the municipal sewer to go in before we did this, which is huge. Once it’s cash flowing, we will start replacing some of the RV sites with prefabricated cabins to capture some of that market. 

The other option would be ask for $6-7MM from him and try and build a hotel, or do feasibility and try and sell it as a development to a hotel group once the sewer is in.

I reached out a couple times and they said they'd be willing to negotiate ""half"" or something like that as they used the money for a deposit elsewhere, lol. I'm really not sure what to do here. Starting an eviction process seems messy and redundant as they're leaving anyway, and I don't want to scare away any potential buyers either. I do have the contact info for their new apartment as they had previously reached out to me for a background check, I could let them know and potentially screw up their next move but then, again, they might just be stuck here then and force me to evict, or disclose their delinquency and eviction status to whoever wants to buy the place.

So yeah, any thoughts? It's pretty shitty as they've always been on time and communicative in the past and I thought we had a decent relationship.

1223,realestateinvesting,Should I sell or rent my townhouse?,[removed]
1224,realestateinvesting,More or fewer units?,"This is a bit of a generic question.

Say you can buy a $400,000 1 bed/a bath 4-plex that rents for $4,000 a month in C+ area.

Or you can buy $400,000 2 bed/2 bath duplex that also rents for $4,000 a month in a C+ or B- area.

Which one would you prefer? The specific numbers don’t matter, but the idea is that you get better bigger units and fewer tenants with the same cap rate.

My thinking is that more tenants = diversification. More tenants = more headache, and probably worse tenant quality because obviously the 1 bed/1 bath units are not something people want to live in unless they are single/students, while 2 bed/2 bath is more of a lifestyle choice - spending more for a nicer property.

I would think though that people paying $2,000 for bigger units would potentially downsize in the event of a recession, and it will be harder to keep them rented.

Just rambling. But what do you prefer on average? More doors and diversification? Or fewer high-quality tenants and work for the same income?"

I work for a remote very rural city of about 1500 people.  Part of my job is to set up new water accounts.  In December a property sold and the new owners did not come in to set up service.  Normally when this happens, we send a friendly reminder and leave utilities connected for a reasonable amount of time.  In this case, shortly after the close, a main water line busted and literally filled the basement of this house with water before a neighbor noticed.

We shut the water off and I immediately tried to research the new owner since our initial letters got no response.  So here is the weird thing.  The house was bought by a Utah llc (we are in utah) who's address is listed as WY and the registered Agent is listed as Utah.  When I checked to see who the principal was, it lists a holding company.  The LLC has an odd name, its literally something like 123W 400Sllc.  a street address with llc after it.  When I research the holding company I get only one name, say for example Ruth Smith, except it is an uncommon name.  When I research that name I come up with a unlv student who is a social work major.  When I google her name dozens and dozens of llc's pop up in virtually every state, all seem to have something to do with real estate investment.

I am in the north Dallas area and I have looked at 2 rental properties for a long-term hold. One is a 2000 built home in an established city. The other is 10 minutes north in an up and coming city but brand new construction being sold by the builder. Everything else from the price to the square footage is the same with very similar floor plans. Running rental comps it appears that is the same as well. The older house has no upgrades while the new build has decent upgrades. The only downside is that the new build has an HOA which has 10% rental cap. The builder has nominated lots for rentals and the one I looked at is one of them. My concern is that this may pose an issue in the future when renewing if after the builder exits and home owners take over the HOA, the rules may change or they may have their own waitlist for rentals. I would then have to sell out and leave but hopefully the neighborhood would be built by then, it's near completion and I can cash out some equity.

If I am to cash out refinance, I'd have enough to **B**uy the next property, but I'll need a construction renovation loan as well to **R**eno it. At that point, there are two debt services to be paid, and the **R**ent no longer covers it. Is there something I'm missing for the **R**epeat part?

I’ve had this insecurity for a long time but don’t know really what to do. I live in a HCOL area so the only way to find RE deals worth doing are to cold call, knock on doors, etc but I find that way super exhausting with a full time job that takes around ~50 hrs a week on average.

The other way is to just keep grinding at my job but the taxes are literally going to kill me the more I make and the method doesn’t scale. What would you do in my situation?"

( saving up for first property out of college) I’m not talking about doing crazy renovations but when I hear some landlords on YouTube about maximizing roi they talk about getting the cheapest lights and door handles, paint etc (landlord special). However, I can speak for my self that having a place that seems very basic you are more likely to leave vs possibly a place that has a more stylish feel. As when a tenant leaves their is a cost to fix up the place new paint etc and downtime until other tenants arrive."

I have a vacancy that I’ve been renovating since October but it’s just been very difficult to find the time while working a full time job. The other unit is about to be vacant after this month &amp; also needs a renovation. Actually all the units with the exception of the one that we live in, need renovations. 

The cap rate on the properties are actually laughable (2-4%) and won’t actually make real money until the mortgages are paid off since taxes/insurance are going up so insanely. I work a pretty well paying job &amp; often wonder if this is worth it.

Looking to use my VA loan for my first property purchase. 

Right now I’m looking at a duplex (3bd/2bath each unit) that’s $280,000. Mortgage $2,100/month. 
HoA fees $51.00/month

Use a property manager to rent out and take care of 1 side. (Not sure how much that is just yet)

It looks like 3bd/2bath houses/apartments average rent is about $1500.00+ in the area.


And the other option is 3bd/3bath houses for about $310,000+. 
All with $50.00-$600.000/yr  HoA fees
Mortgage averaging about 2400-3000.

It seems like the Duplex would be a great option. But I could really use some advice. I am a newb when it comes to all of this and am trying to learn as much as I can before I move and make a purchase.

Wether we want to sell our current property when the time comes, and hopefully the market will bless us with a hefty value for our home. (Cash out, in my opinion the easy way) or…

Hire a property manager, and essentially be in charge of both properties at the same time. The house will be paying itself off but I don’t know how much I’d be paying out of pocket for that kind of service and I’m just wondering if it would be feasable or maybe stupid to do so.

In the future I would love to be a landlord and take on that responsibility, but right now I’m only 20 and I guess my intuition is telling me to go the easy route and just cash out.

i'd love to have a few of these going but i'm struggling with the numbers right now. housing pricing here has cooled off a bit but it's not tanking at all and demand is high so there's no swooping in to snag some super awesome deal because well, there's no super awesome deals to be had.

basically i have 6 figures in my bank account annoying me because it's not making me any money sitting there. stocks are too volatile. so i feel like an idiot for sitting on this cash. last year i did a few i bonds, as much as i could both personally and in my business. i could do the same this year as well.

-------

I held my first job ever from October 2018 and it ended in january 2019. It was an internship.

My second job was from September 2019 and ended on March 2020. Company lay offs due to Covid.

My third job was from December 2020 to June 2021. This was a 6 month contract position, finished it and moved on.

My most recent position was from March 2022 and ended recently in early January 2023 this year.

*As of now,* I am applying to other full time jobs and I'm working on some contract and freelance positions like I've done during work gaps to keep income. All the jobs I mentioned are the same industry (I work in computer graphics)

--------
TLDR i have 2 years of work history total but with gaps
--------

-------

As you can see, I have only a total of 2.1 (26 months of work experience total). According to the FHA requirements online it says:

**Your eligibility for an FHA loan doesn't hinge on a particular income amount, but you must prove that you have a steady employment history. Your income must be verifiable by sharing pay stubs, W-2s, federal tax returns and bank statements with your lender. Your lender may ask for other examples of verification as well.**

But that feels a little vague to me. What does ""steady"" employment history mean exactly? Sure I haven't consistently had a full time job without gaps, but I've had other forms of income during those gaps (albeit much less than I make from full time 9 to 5); so would the spotty history really be an issue?

And if it *is* an issue what do you suggest I do from here on out?"

1. Net Operating Income- (Total income- operating expenses, mortgage not included)  Roughly 1575\*12= 18,900-50%??. No idea what expenses would be but I read 50% which seems REALLY high and would not leave enough to cover the mortgage. What is a realistic percentage?
2. Cap Rate= NOI/Property value. I can't figure this out without a realistic estimate for #1.
3. Cash Flow- More data needed for NOI.
4. Gross Rent Multiplier- $215,000/$18,900= 11.375. Is it true anything above 10 is a potential money pit? 4-8 seem like unicorn properties. 
5. Occupancy Rate- I read to plan for 5%-10% which is like 1 month a year.  This seems like a reasonable amount of time to clean, list and fill if tenants only stay for 1 year.

1335,realestateinvesting,Buying a house in Italy but bank requests other things?,"So to clarify, my partner is trying to buy a small apartment in Italy. He found one for around 55k and the owner was happy to sell.

However, to get a loan from the bank and to have the house checked to make sure everything is in order and to have a certificate signed and for someone to witness this all adds up to around 14k. My partner in Italy has never done this and as someone from the UK I have no understanding of how the way things work in Italy. I've tried reading multiple things on Google which has good information, however I struggle to understand this.

We are unsure of how to proceed as he would need to take money out of his retirement in order for this to work. The bank said the mortgage would be 300 euros a month for 20 years which honestly doesnt sound bad to me but the 14k for all that other stuff seems a bit much. I don't have all the info now but if needed I can ask him to give a pic of the breakdown of what the 14k is for.

The person selling was ok to reduce to price of the house to 50k which is nice and they offered to leave things in which is super kind. So he andi really wanna invest in the house.

I offered some of my life savings but he refused. This is because I'm an ex Muslim struggling to escape my family. You can read about this more in my previous posts in the ex Muslim sub. I've been struggling a lot financially as I have to help pay for my families stuff here in the UK. My fundraiser failed only 2 people donated £30. I've not saved all that much for my escape and unfortunately authorities dont care about my situation. It's a sad life. I know people have it worse but I want to get out of this Muslim house. I'm terrified of honour killing and all that and I know people say this stuff doesnt happen in the UK but my parents originate from Bangladesh. What happens if they force me on a plane to go there and shit happens? Not many people understand this ex Muslim thing so I highly recommend reading about it on the ex Muslim sub or listening to some ex Muslim stories. It's horrible.

Anyway, we are both tight on money but really want to proceed with this as we want a stable home for the future. Can anyone please share some advice? I could really use some as I really am having a hard time figuring this out whilst dealing with a shit load of things in my house. Emotionally I'm drained and I want to help my partner. He is feeling upset because the chance to finally move came and now he is stuck with money. 

Any advice would be very much appreciated. 

Thank you."

The house is almost done and I need to sell it to recoup my money but I can't figure out how to recoup my money. Wondering if I should take a hard loan against the property for as much as I can before completion of the house. Also in a small 1031 exchange pickle if I go that way because I want to sell the house as soon as it's built and while the house was rented for months at a time for years on and off while I claimed it as a primary, I can't rent the new construction before I put it up for sale. 

Does anyone have any advice I can bring to my accountant? Any type of lawyer who can help with this. 

I expect a sale price of 4 million and cost to construct was 1.3 mil. Big bucks I can lose out on here. 

Here are some ideas I have if I can 1031 exchange someway somehow:

1. purchase property in Nevada and roll money into Nevada and move to Nevada and claim residency for 5 years - then sell Nevada property. Do I save taxes later on if I do this?
2. purchase income property in California and cash out refinance after new purchase is complete 
3. take a hard money loan for as much as I can before house is finished - is this even allowed?

I was having problems with other tenants who were not paying rent at all, so I did not want to rock the boat. They’re paying $2000, per month for 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, the market rent is $3700 per month. I am now increasing their rent by $100, per year. I try to increase it by $200 per year but they are refusing, to pay more than $100 per year. I can’t keep up with the expenses, to run that building, everything went up. They have been there for 16 years. Am thinking about moving them out, because I will never get market rent as long as I keep them, and the cost to maintain the building will keep going up. I made a big mistake for not raising their rents over the years. They showed me that they don’t want to pay more than $100 increase per year. They talk to each other these tenants , and compare notes. Should I give them notice to move at the same time or one at a time?"
1352,realestateinvesting,Need help with exit strategy,"I’m a one-and-done rental property owner and I am seeking advice on my exit strategy.

I’ve run the numbers, and between the numbers showing me that it would be better to sell sooner than later, and my personality not being cut out for this, I’m weighing options for making the transition from owner-occupied duplex to single-family-home living (in same region) as stress-free and risk-free as possible.

Due to repairs, my 2021 tax return showed a loss on my schedule E, and it’s lowered my Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio. Also, the doubling of interest rates since I bought the duplex has decreased my purchasing power. So even though I have a high credit score and a very secure w2 job, and plan to buy a house that costs less than my duplex, I currently don’t qualify for a second mortgage without a home sale contingency (still a deal-breaker, according to local realtors I've talked to.)

I’d rather not do a bridge loan, due to the possibility of something coming up during inspection to slow down a sale, or cause me to have to sell at a loss. (It’s appreciated a lot since I bought it, and in a desirable location, but it’s old and there have been many $$ surprises in the 2.5 years I’ve owned it.) I know I could “always rent out both units,” but that wouldn’t solve the problem of me wanting to get out of the landlord business. And no, hiring a property management company isn’t a good enough fix (for me).

I’d ideally find a house first, and then carry the 2 mortgages until the duplex sold, but not under the additional time-pressure of the bridge loan, which is essentially a third mortgage and involves maximum risk/stress, from everything I've read.

So how do I improve my DTI so that a loan officer would make me a better offer? I’m too busy between landlording and my W2 job to generate another income stream, so apart from spending less and saving more, here are the additional options I am considering:

1. File my 2022 taxes this month without deducting most of my rental property expenses, apart from depreciation, making it look like I have more “taxable income”. Downside: I will lose the $3000-$5000 refund I would otherwise get for allowable 2022 losses against W2 income. (I’m in the right income bracket for that.)

2. Also lower my contribution pre-tax to my 403-B in 2023, to also raise my taxable income, so if I can’t manage to get a good mortgage this year, perhaps I can next year. (Does pre-tax retirement contribution affect DTI?)

3.  Sell, then rent, then buy. Biggest risk here is that I get stuck renting when I want to own. 

Thanks for input on the above, and for throwing out any other ideas I haven’t thought of yet."

I am tempted to take the contract to a bank and “refinancing” (?) the properties into separate loans. Then I assume I could draw my equality from these loans over time.. does this make sense? Anyone with land contract experience?

1358,realestateinvesting,Tell me we can do it (House Hack),"There has been a particular duplex outside of Denver that we have been watching. 2b 1ba in both units. Pricing started at $525k around October. Dec decreased it to $500k. About 6 days they cut it $444k. 

I did get off the phone with Rocket Mortgage yesterday and have already been pre approved for the amount @ 6% interest and 5% down ($22k).

First question and the reason we are even having the discussion about house hacking is taking advantage of the first time home buyer, 5% down only needed. Rocket said I can only do this once with a duplex. Or I’ll have to do 25% in the future. Is that true? Do I only have one time chance to use this low down payment option?

Here’s the numbers. 
$444k @ 6% = $3029 per month and that includes prop tax, home insurance, pmi ($65). What can rent be $1500 to $1800 for the nice unit. (Researched duplex in the same area).

The one unit is occupied and they are living in the remodeled unit (kitchen and bath). We would take the vacant non remodeld side. Nothing inherently wrong, just older and with the idea we remodel as we live there over time.

Even for the sake of being in a stable home. Splitting the $3029 is ok to us as this is still to use cheap. Then over time we can easily raise rent to $1800. To use this rent would allow us to save, for a future home as well. We would like to also bring a child into the world soon. (Bio clock) refinance later when we can.

We have combined $130k but when she stops working eventually. We’ll have just mine and that’s $92k, $4500 a month take home. Only real problem is we have $2400 saved. This scares me as I would have no reserve and would have to pull the down payment from my Roth 401k. I have $50k in contributions that can be pulled penalty free.

Beside the no reserves is there anything missing that says we can’t do this? $1200-$1500 a month is cheap to us and this has been a better price than a condo or townhome."

My question is - and I know I’m probably going to get downvoted for this, but I really want to know:

Is there any way to record me as 100% owner (vs 50%) without going through the costly, time consuming, risky quiet title process

For example:

Since I own 50%, could I create a deed that shows I’m selling 100% of the property to an LLC that I own

If I were to do that and have it notarized, couldn’t I have it recorded without a problem?

That way when I go to refinance or leverage the property it shows the deed as 100% my name vs the 50%?

As mentioned, there was a deed error years ago (thanks to the attorney that made the error), I purchased and own 50%, and the person that owned the other 50% has been deceased for 20 years

* Comparable rents around the area are $2,300
*  The school district is pretty good

We are a single-income household, with a gross income of 195K, current savings of $170K, and 110K in a brokerage account, for a total of $280K available for a downpayment of the new house. Our only debt is a car payment of $720/per month.  

My realtor friend told me that my house is too nice to be rented and that tenants will destroy it. But if I sell it, I have to pay a realtor a 5% commission and then if I buy a smaller rental in a different area I will have closing costs. 

If I keep the house, I want to hire a property management company. I know this will eat any cash flow, but I won't have to deal with tenants and the paperwork.    Most of the rental income will go to pay down the principal, and in 8 years house will be a payoff.  

My other idea is to pre-furnish the house and hire an STR property manager. STR can bring better margins but also go the other way around and be in a negative return pretty quickly. The positive is no evection risk, unlike long-term rental.  (I live in California)

What would you do in my situation?

I appreciate any help you can provide."
1396,realestateinvesting,Small Biz owner looking for best way to show income for first property,"I’m a lawn maintenance company owner (23M) the company did $220k in 2022. Bought a lot of equipment in 2022 since we just started 2 years ago so my expenses were $160k. 

But with our contracts in 2023 we’ll do at least $250k this year and likely will only have $60k or so of expenses since we have all the equipment paid for. 

My question is, when I see a accountant for taxes, should I amortize forward some of the business expenses for 2022 and take a higher tax bill for 2022, so that I can get approved for more money on a mortgage? Should I show less expenses?

What kind of mortgage could I get approved for with my ~$65k of shown income. Would it be worth it to show more income?

I have $60k liquid, $100k (resale value) of trucks and equipment, and no debt. 

Looking to buy a duplex to hold. Not really interested in flipping. I have friends in the RE business and I’m handy. 

I also rent for $1500 a month in a single bedroom, which for my area in the Midwest, is pretty high. So I would be interested in living in one side of a duplex if I bought one. Looking at one asking $258,000 in my area that isn’t run down. 

Should I eat a higher tax bill and show ~$100k of income instead of ~$65k and hop into investing? Thanks"
1397,realestateinvesting,Looking for anyone with experience contesting insurance,"A quick story. A property we're working on had a flooded basement when we returned to work on the house. Pipes burst between work days and insurance is denying the claim as they don't cover ""frozen pipes"".

We installed a new furnace about 6 weeks before the incident and had been in there three times after, it was warm and the water worked.

Insurance reasoning is this: new high efficiency furnaces have their exhausts blocked from frozen condensation in very cold weather, causing the furnace to turn off, and then pipes freeze. The adjuster has also recommended that when the weather gets cold, I turn the water off so they freeze and don't burst, and we replace them (every winter...), and also said we should be there to check the property in very cold weather but our policy is to have work done at least every 30 days. 

We have a construction policy, have been very open about what construction is to be done and the time frame. We said 4-6 months for flooring, kitchen, painting and told insurance we'd be out every couple weeks.

Do I have grounds to contest this? It seems strange that a brand new furnace would fail this way, and we actually don't know what happened first (pipes burst to flood the furnace, or furnace shut off). It seems like this is exactly what insurance is for, a sudden accident despite prevention.

Anyone have experience with insurance disagreements or this high efficiency furnace failure?"

1400,realestateinvesting,Buy a property by “pre-selling holiday access”,"Hi all,

Situation:
I have been looking to invest in a property in a different country that I would like to move to in the future. If possible I would like to move in around 10years and potentially CoastFIRE or work remote from there. I am currently living in a VHCOL area in Europe and would like to move to my second home country in the south. I have been looking at different properties and have found “a dream house” in my desired area. It is quite a bit out of reach for me at this stage as I do not have the required 20-30% (depending if I’d buy it as my main home or as a vacation home) downpayment. It is an extremely large house (10bedrooms and 2000sq/m = 21500sq/f) with a tremendous garden, forest, tiny river and private hunting area belonging to the property. I would be able to pay the mortgage without a problem but I personally only have about 7% of the required 20-30% for the downpayment. 

I was talking with friends and family about it and due to the size of the property considered to sell the rights to vacation in the house for the future. If I decide to move there permanently I would still have enough space without having to worry too much about the hosting of other people. There is a separated building from the main house which would permit to have numerous guests in the main house without affecting me too much. I like to host, I might want to have kids in the future and I would even enjoy starting a BedN’Breakfast out of this property which would all be possible with this property.



Idea:
Let us assume the following costs:
- Total Purchase Price: 1.5Mio $
- Downpayment: 30% = 450k $

I would now sell my family and friends that share interest their “free access” to the property in the future. Let us assume:
- my brother wants to invest 15k $ and he will receive in a private contract with me the right to : have 2 rooms (kids and he and his wife) for a total of 2 weeks per year for the following 15years. This would result in a weekly cost per room of 250$ which is extremely low compared to around 400$ low season / 1200$ high season that similar places would cost according to AirDNA.
- also a friend would invest 50k because he wants to live there during the next 10 winters for a total period of 15weeks each time max. to flea the cold winter where we live now
- add a few more such deals and there we go



Questions:
1.) Do you know if this model of “pre-selling future vacation home access” has a specific name in Real Estate?

2.) Have you seen such private arrangements work / not work on any occasion? 



Final Statements:
I know there are numerous legal topics that would need to be considered and both I and my potential future visitors would require a lot of support for this investment.
I would prefer to remain the sole owner on the papers for the entire property so that no one would have rights to make any requests or decisions on how to renovate/maintain the property. But of course with some legal clause saying I must guarantee a certain standard and easy access etc. etc. for all investors as well as offer a certain convenient platform to pre-book their rooms so that it would work out well. Also consider on an individual basis if I want to make the right to access hereditary or not etc. 
Important for me is to differentiate it from so-called Co-Ownership places as I would really only sell on a discount way the access and the whole maintenance, mortgage etc. would remain with me only.

I see the following advantages:
- be able to afford such a luxury place that otherwise would not be possible
- when I’d move there I would receive “mandatory” visit of friends and family
- be able to pay down the mortgage now while still earning a very high income and then in the future when potentially CoastFiring not having to worry too much anymore

Disadvantage:
- by “selling the access” I would probably lose a certain privacy even though the house is big enough
- I would potentially lose future money due to having sold the access in current money and prices
- Legal or other issues could damage the relationship

Thanks for your feedback and time to read all of this. Hope it is understandable."

1408,realestateinvesting,"Buy and undervalued property, Increase rents and Balloon payment extension clause","I’m looking at an off market six unit multi family property that has very low rents, way under current market rates ($700 average currently vs $1200 market rate) with a low price of $550k, but the property would probably appraise in the $750k to $900k range. 

My thought is to acquire the property and increase rents and change some of the units into MTRs.

The property is barely breaking even because the rents are so low. I I’m not sure why they’re under market rate so I doubt I’ll be able to get regular financing and be able to make it cashflow. The seller will consider a short seller carry in the range of a few years with a balloon payment due at the end. 

A few questions: 

1) How do you go about increasing rents with such a big discrepancy between current rate vs market rate? What’s a reasonable time range to give the current tenants?

2) Assuming the seller and I can come to an agreement on seller financing. How would you structure a balloon payment clause to extend the term/ balloon outwards? Is there a way to mitigate the risk of rising interest rate? And mitigate the risk of the property losing value? 

3) I’ve only worked with residential lenders since we’ve house hacked all our multi families so far. Would a commercial lender even look at this property given rents so low if I gave them a plan to increase rents and switch some units to MTR?"

Hey everyone. This will be a long post and I apologize for that, but I would greatly appreciate any advice. 

I will preface this by saying that I am completely new to the world of real estate investing. I do not own any properties (residential nor commercial) and have exactly zero experience in the commercial sector, although I do have residential sales experience as a licensed Realtor in my state along with my primary job in engineering. I want to get involved in investing and land development because I think it would be incredible to bring new life and opportunities to the city I grew up in.

Nobody in my circle is involved in real estate, so I’m building my knowledge and skills by myself from the ground up. And I’m trying to be creative about potential investment opportunities that may or may not actually be feasible, so please don’t hesitate to let me know about any misconceptions I have or gaps in my understanding. I am open to any and all reality checks haha.

\-------------------  
Opportunity &amp; Questions

There is a property in my city at the intersection of a semi-large road and a smaller side road. Listed for $600k. The lot is approx. 9,200 sq ft and is zoned for warehouse/combined business use. But currently the land has 3 separate homes on it which are being rented out as a sort of combined duplex arrangement. In my opinion, the homes are really out of place, as they’re surrounded by businesses, storage facilities, etc. I think the land would be better utilized by tearing the homes down and building a warehouse on it instead.

However I have a few issues with the whole situation. First, I am not sure about what to do with the land after tear-down. Does the land owner typically build a structure and then lease it or secure a tenant first and let them build what they want?

Second, I know that it will be difficult to secure financing with my current cash flow/lack of investment history. I don’t know if this is possible, but if I was able to, will a lender accept a signed lease agreement with a tenant with a well-defined rent payment that covers the monthly payment on the loan as a sort of “proof of income”? If so, would it even be possible to find a tenant to agree to occupy this space before it is built?

The homes occupy about 4200 sq ft and I’ve estimated that the cost of demolition would add an extra 25-30k onto the loan (plus the costs of building/grading which I’ll get to). I planned to offer a triple-net lease and estimate that I can charge about $1 to $1.25/sq ft/month in rent. With a warehouse approx. 7000 sq ft in size, I can theoretically generate $7k to $8.7k in monthly revenue. 

And about the loans -- I am not sure at all if I've done my demo/building cost estimations correctly, as I found countless types of commercial loans out there as well as cost estimations for the various expenses. I'm not sure if I found accurate term lengths, interest rates, or if I would need separate loans for each part of the development process or what. But just for the sake of getting something on paper, I lumped everything together into a single commercial development loan (covering the cost of demo, grading, and building) with a term of 20 years and rate of 6%. Altogether, using upper estimations for costs and lower estimations for income, my numbers look like this:  


\--------------------------------------------

Characteristics

Land area: 9204 sq ft  
Current structures area: 4224 sq ft  
Est. new building area: 7000 sq ft

Costs  
Cost of property (considering price negotiation and closing costs): $600,000  
Cost of demo ($6/sqft): (6\*4224) = \~$26,000  
Cost of grading ($0.1/sqft): (0.1\*9204) = \~$921  
Cost of building new warehouse ($45/sqft) = (45\*7000) = $315,000  
Total: $941,921  
Monthly loan payment at 6% for 20 years: \~$6,748

  
Revenue  
   
Monthly rental income ($1/sqft): (1\*7000) = $7,000  
\------------------------------------------

I understand that these numbers could be way off because I am probably not factoring in many other potential expenses and I used generalized cost estimations I found online. However, it seems that with the rental income and my personal income, it could potentially work out financially. 

This is already way too long so I will end it here. Again, I am open to the possibility that this sort of project is just way too big a fish for someone brand new to CRE. But if there is even a chance that I could pull this off, I have no shortage of motivation to see it through to the end. Or if I am at least on the right track, I would be glad to know that too.

That’s roughly one-sixth the pace of January 2022, when rents were up 15.6% from a year earlier.

January marked the eighth straight month in which annual rent growth slowed. Rents fell 1.9% from a month earlier and were down 5.4% from the August peak of $2,053.

Rent growth is cooling because of slowing demand and growing supply. Demand has slowed due to still-high costs (rents remain 22.5% higher than they were in January 2020), inflation, widespread economic uncertainty and slowing household formation. Rental supply has grown due to an influx of construction in recent years, as well as a recent increase in the number of people opting to rent out their homes instead of sell.

1447,realestateinvesting,Wanting to get into REI but how on earth is this market sustainable?,"So I've been lurking here for a while now, trying to sponge up as much info as possible. I'd love to eventually switch from my W2 job to a RE investment/investor type role. 

But then I look at the prices in the last 5 years and I wonder how anyone could be 'getting in' right now and actually able to turn a profit (or at least not lose money)? 

I'm in the midwest/south in a LCOL(ish) area. It seems starter homes around me are going for 200-250k. That's what I was thinking my wheelhouse was but how the hell would some kid be able to afford that? I was thinking about a few houses like this, renting to couples getting started. Or doing guts/flips the proper way. I have tons of friends in the trades so a 'team' wouldn't be a problem.

It's like the snake eating it's tail. Corps are snatching up everything around me, paying 10k cash over asking because they have bigger war chests than us. How can the little guy compete with that?

I'm sure it's mostly fear but just from a mile high viewpoint, it doesn't look feasible. Am I completely just Chicken Littling this thing? Thanks!"

1460,realestateinvesting,Help evaluate the deal,"Hey guys,

As always, your advice is amazing.

I am looking at this deal, please share your thoughts.

This property is in a Midwestern city. 

It’s in one of the best areas of the city (important). Great safe location, a big gorgeous brick duplex, 2bed/1bath 1250 square foot each unit.

Here is the thing. It was listed 8 months(!) ago for $270,000. No price drops. 

I call the agent and ask to tell more. She says they went under contract first week, then buyers failed and the owner doesn’t want to drop the price despite low interest rates. Also, the listing is poor quality because there are no interior photos.

I estimated rents around $1,100 a unit, so won’t cash flow at $270,000, no wonder no one wants it.

A few days ago I find the owner and text him. He says he won’t drop below $240,000. That’s a HUGE difference. 

I offered $220,000 and we do the deal off market, so he saves $15,000 on agent fees.

He says the agent is his friend so he will drop to $231,500 for not using my agent. 

I promised to come back to him soon.

What I know: both tenants pay $1,100, are month to month, and lived there for 5 years. The interior (he sent me photos) is a bit dated. The exterior looks gorgeous. 

Now if I get it for $225,000 at 20% down and 7.25% DSCR loan, I cash flow 3.36% CoC with a manager fee. If I push rents to $1,200, then 7.33%. I will self manage, but think it’s appropriate to calculate the management expenses anyway. 

I would typically not consider CoC below 10%. 

However, here is my reasoning with this property: it looks like great real estate. I don’t want to buy based on emotion, but as a tenant, I would feel proud to live there. I would think this leads to a lower vacancy rate and could make the property a decent AirBnB. 

A normal cap rate in the worse parts of city (C areas) is 7.5-8%. This property based on current rents is 6.73%. It’s a B area so no duplex comps there.

I am a numbers guy, but here intuition and aesthetics make me feel it’s a good deal?"
1461,realestateinvesting,Estimating turnover time?,"Hi all,

First post here; really appreciate all the knowledge I’ve picked up from this sub.  Now, please accept my apologies for the long-ish post.

We’ve had a three family house for ten years (we live in one unit) just north of NYC (so HCOL area).  One of our tenants is moving out of her two bedroom.  With our permission a couple years ago she had painted and installed a bit of new flooring that we paid for but…meh.  The unit hasn’t been fully renovated for well over ten years but is still thankfully in decent shape.  While we could probably re-rent quickly as-is, a full paint job, full floor replacement, some trim repair, new vanity, new fridge, new lights and ceiling fans should be beneficial to tenant quality and rent roll.  We’re getting prices for all the work then will decide what to farm out, what to do ourselves and what to punt to the next cycle.  Obviously the goal is to minimize vacancy by using good, fast &amp; cheap (!) labor.  I expect we won’t advertise until the work is at least mostly or fully complete.  We’ve been blessed with only one major rehab in 20-years as a landlord, always no-vacancy turnovers, never such a significant refresh between cycles so I turn now to the experience of Reddit for insight. 

Question 1:  How long should we budget for the vacancy for that level of work with some fluff?  Four weeks?  Six?  Eight?  Quotes will tell us some but won’t likely give a full picture including contingency and coordination. 

Question 2:  Current rent (from early 2020, ) is $1650 + utils.  If we rented as-is, I believe we could quickly get $2000.  After all the described work, my estimate is $2300.  Our philosophy is that the value of the extra work to attract good tenants and maintain the property long-term offsets the immediate cash (read ‘low fixed rate HELOC’) outlay.  We typically set rents slightly under market max so as to recession-proof the cashflow and minimize turnover.  Change our minds. 

Anything else you can think of related to our current situation is welcomed and very much appreciated.  We just don’t have time to make all the mistakes to learn the lessons ourselves!"

1465,realestateinvesting,WIRE FRAUD - Is there interest for an ultra-secure 3rd party wire info verification? Goal is add redundancy and more peace of mind.,"Wire fraud is on the rise. Even if it represents a very small portion of transactions, we should all check the wire info we get. But it is time consuming for both investors and escrow companies.

I am thinking about setting up a ultra-secure wire info verification website.

For security reasons (ah!), I can’t give details.

Audience:

\- Escrow companies and any person sharing their wire/bank info.

\- Investors having to wire funds.

&amp;#x200B;

The escrow/bank would add some url / code to their emails, docs, and the investor could verify online if that’s valid. Investor can still call the escrow company for additional verification.

It gives more confidence to everyone. And escrow companies reduce the overhead for checking wires on the phone. It does not remove anything to the process, it adds some redundancy, and an additional layer of protection.

&amp;#x200B;

It does not solve the issue about the escrow companies‘ e-mail being hacked (all bets are off then), but it would reduce the burden for 99% of the normal emails/wire/transaction where there is no fraud.

Thoughts? Is there a market for that?"

* Although, rent between 2-bed and 3-bed is nearly $300!

&amp;#x200B;

I looked in past years and across all the counties. Three-bed units almost always rent for significantly more. It may be because stand-alone houses usually rent higher than multi-units or apartment layouts. And I would guess most stand-alone houses, in my state, are three-bed. Any other ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

This is for 40th percentile rents:

&gt; Fair Market Rent is generally calculated as the 40th percentile of gross  rents for regular, standard quality units in a local housing market.  This excludes low-quality units, already subsidized units, and units  that have been built in the last 2 years. FMR rent data is typically  taken from recent move ins rather than long-term tenants, as long-term  tenants generally receive a lower monthly rental rate. FMR includes core  utilities, like water and power, but doesn’t include internet and other  optional services.   In order to calculate Fair Market Rents, HUD utilizes several different  sets of data, including gross rents data from the U.S. Census Bureau,  gross rent information from HUD’s American Housing Survey, as well as  additional rental rate data gleaned from yearly telephone surveys."

1476,realestateinvesting,What are my options?,"What are my options?

I want to invest in a multi family property but I live in a HCOL area so here’s my scenario…

Currently own small SFH with VA loan which I refied to 2.25% pre covid. I did many improvements to the house and it needs nothing. Similar houses in my area are renting for about $1,000 more a month than what I pay for my mortgage. The house itself is work about 120k more than what I paid (conservative estimate).  HELOC is available and local credit union is great and have dealt with them in the past. 

I want to buy/possibly move into one unit of a multi family home. Decent MFH in my area are currently in the 600,000-800,000 range. Smaller 2 bedrooms multis that don’t need much work. Anything nicer is easily $1,000,000+. Rents for these vary from 2k-2.8k depending on how nice the units are and location. 

I have no debts besides my mortgage and a great credit score 800+

I do shift work and have no problem with being a landlord and treating it like a job and being available for tenants/issues with the home. 

So my question…is this realistic for me? Or not worth the risk? 

I also have a friend who is in the same boat (VA loan on SFH) and looking to invest so we’ve been crunching numbers and thinking about partnering up. (I know bad idea don’t invest with friends)

So what would you recommend?

Thanks!"
1477,realestateinvesting,Buying and Building on a Multifamily Zoned Lot,"Hi, I've been a long time reader here and am looking at what could possibly be my first big deal in Real Estate. Wanted to see if anyone would be able to offer any insight before I get started.

I know someone who has a multi family zoned lot in a desirable neighborhood in Philadelphia with an old building on it. He has had investors reach out to him to buy the lot before, but he basically turns them down because he doesn't want to sell to people he doesn't know. I think he would be willing to sell to me.

I want to buy the lot from him and build an apartment building (I am envisioning anything from 4-8 apartments). I would be working with family of mine to get the money to buy his land, and then hoping to be able to work with a lender to fund the construction, using the land as collateral. I do plan on living in one of the apartments once everything is complete, if that is of any significance.

If you were in my shoes, where would you start (assuming he would accept my offer to buy)? Do I reach out to a real estate lawyer first? I assume the seller probably doesn't want to include agents unless I am paying for them myself. Would the real estate lawyer then put me in touch with architects?

Should I go to the city planner (if there even is one for Philadelphia?) before going to a lawyer? How much of the permitting and design process should be done before buying the land? I read online that many people just agree in contract on the 'option' to purchase the property, and they only exercise that option once financing, permitting, and design are complete. How true is that?

I think this is a really good opportunity for me and want to take advantage of it, but don't want to go in unprepared and make a huge financial mistake. Any advice is very much appreciated. Thank you!"

1479,realestateinvesting,The most important skill to learn in Real Estate,"There are 2 skills you need to learn to be successful in wholesaling. 

They are sales and marketing. Today I’m going to share some tips on sales. 

I’ve been in Sales for almost a decade and a half and I’ve consistently been a top producer. 

But it wasn’t always that way. When I went from working in call centers to selling cars at 19 years old, I quickly realized there was a lot more to sales than I thought there was. 

At the dealership I worked at there was no training. It was sink or swim and it was cut throat.

None of the other salesmen wanted you to be successful because they all had a scarcity mindset. 

I used to think sales was something you were either born with or you weren’t. 

Eventually I  found out there were books on sales and bought a book called the little red sales book 

I read it and applied it and I got better. 

I came to realize that sales was a skill that you could get better at with, like anything else. 

Since then I’ve read countless books and have invested tens of thousands of dollars on courses on sales. 

Here are some of the best ways to get better at sales quickly.

1. Record your self - the greatest athletes always watch previous game tapes to find ways they can improve. Sales is the same. Record your calls and study them. Take notes on what you can improve on and what you did well. 

2. use a script and write out rebuttals to common objections - you need a script, it helps you stay on track and progress towards the close. There’s only so many objections you will get and if you already know how to respond before you get the objection it’s a game changer. 

3 . Study the greats, invest in books- some of my favorites are never split the difference and the way of the wolf

Keep working on improving daily and you will get better at sales. It’s just a matter of doing the work consistently.  If you want a copy of my script, let me know and I’ll shoot you over the one I use in my business."

I’ve been told by many real estate experts that this will never happen again. Some disagree. It obviously won’t be the same because of new regulation but anything is possible. Opinions? 

I just cannot see this happening when the market is no longer reliant on the ease of distribution of triple B rated mortgage bonds and is regulated under more scrutiny.

IMO: There is far too much inventory for this to happen again. The problem is, there is not enough demand. What does this tell you (those who are real estate investors). How? I just cannot see this happening when the market is no longer reliant on subprime mortgage bonds. There is far too much inventory for this to happen again. The problem is, there is not enough demand. 

What does this tell you as a real estate investor? Should I be concerned about a possible collapse? What is the ideal amount of my assets i should set aside if my net worth exceeds over $400,000-1,000,000 for example. (Not saying this is the case; just a scenario).

1507,realestateinvesting,1031 Excess Funds ... back into one of the acquired properties?," 

Hi All

I urgently need to know if I can invest leftover funds in a 1031 exchange into one of the properties acquired during the exchange?

Here is what happened..

We setup a 1031 as we sold a rental property. We identified 3 properties. Closed on one... thought we could acquire one of the others but the purchases fell through... so now we are stuck with a huge capital gain and the taxes that go with that.... if we do nothing and let the 1031 run its course.

So could I take the ""leftover funds"" and pay off the loan on the 1 property we did acquire? All of this done through the 1031 exchange company? (The funds are never in our hands.)

Would this work?

If not... do you have any other ideas of how to legally rollover or buy something else, etc.???

Thank you!"

Thanks in advance."
1513,realestateinvesting,Perfect Storm,"We found a building in Fort St. John BC last year. It was undervalued and had lots of potential. 

The owner was mentally incapable of being a landlord or property manager. He was using 2 of the 12 units as personal storage, and only 2 of the units had tenants. 

After inspections and appraisal, we knew some light renovations &amp; a qualified property manager would bring in tenants. 

We had a local representative from C21 tour the building and she said she’d be asking 1200-1300 all day for the suits and she’d fill them easily. 

We were working with a local credit union &amp; CMHC to get financing. After about 70 days, the credit union told us that CMHC hasn’t responded to them and they couldn’t help. At that point, we had about a week till closing, and the owner refused to extend. 

We got we’re offered an expensive 100% loan from a B lender, but we knew we’d only need it for a few months until we filled the place up. So we took it and bought the building. 

Then, the tenant pool basically dried up overnight. That lady from our property managers firm turned out to be insane, and got fired. We found out she’d been lying and the rents were more like 800-900.

We’ve finished renovations now, and can’t find tenants.

6 months later, we’ve got 7 tenants in. 

Then we couldn’t figure out why it still wasn’t producing much income, now we find out the PM fucked up and rented all 7 of them with hydro included, and these people are using almost 300/mo in electricity.

Then interest rates went up.

My savings is basically spent. The financials look like shit because most of the profits are going to hydro.

I’m struggling to make 10k/mo payments to the B lender.

Nobody wants to lend us a normal mortgage. Nobody wants to buy it because it shows a low cap rate because our PM is terrible. 

I’m so stressed. This has so much potential and now I’m panicking."

1526,realestateinvesting,Single Family home in nicer neighborhood or multi family in average neighborhood?,"Background: Spouse and I currently own a single family 3/2 in a good suburban location for the city we live in. Mortgage is low and I’m not worried about being able to rent it out. Overall the city is a LCOL area. My spouse and I are in our 30’s with stable careers and above average pay for the area. We will not be growing the family. We’re looking to buy a second home and start building a real estate portfolio.

Multi family homes are somewhat common where we live and I’ve been looking at some working class neighborhoods that would put me closer to work, closer to downtown, and open up the option for a detached studio rental. These neighborhoods aren’t necessarily rough or unsafe, but they tend to have a mixed bag of rundown/unkept homes and homes that are well cared for. The homes I’m looking at in these areas would put us at about a $1.4k-$1.5k mortgage, but the separate studio apartment would also likely rent in the $500-$600 per month range pretty easily.

Now with the market cooling homes are occasionally popping up in the nicer neighborhoods at the top end of our price range. These homes tend to be a bit bigger, single family homes. They’re a little closer to downtown, but the neighborhoods tend to be kept well and have a lot more outdoor activities and community events. I feel overall this would contribute to better quality of life and we’d be in a neighborhood with similar career minded individuals. These homes do not have the option for rental income at our price range. The mortgage would likely be somewhere around the $1.7k-1.8k mark.

We don’t need a larger house and would prefer to downsize, but the nicer neighborhoods seem to be full of larger homes and larger lots (larger lot is a plus for us). Both situations would fall below the 28% rule for us, thankfully. We also plan to refinance when rates go down again. Just curious to hear if anyone else has been in a similar situation. On paper buying the cheaper house with a separate studio in the average neighborhood makes a lot of sense, but I’m not sure how to put a dollar value on quality of life for a home in a nicer neighborhood."

I wanted to propose a deal I found and run the numbers past this much smarter, million strong community for input. As the saying goes, ""you don't know what you don't know"" and I'm sure I'm missing key pieces of info. I'm going to list the specs the way the seller has pitched it. That way you can see how the deal is being presented and show me what it's actually lacking / concealing?

(FYI I would guess these are Class C rentals based on the pics and avg rents)

**The Deal**

2x Triplex units sold as a package. (all 6 units are 2b/1bath). The buildings were built in 1972, each unit is 900 sq/ft, single car space with extra parking around the front and back, the 2 buildings share a water meter which is why they're being sold together. According to the listing ""rent ready, minimal cosmetic updates needed""

**Unit 1:** Fully rented. Rents are $1100, $1050, $1050

* Market Rents: $1150/ea (supposedly) *\[need to do my own research on market rents\]*
* Purchase: $425k
* Down payment: $60k
* Seller carry note is $365k, 4% int. 43-year amort. Payment is $1500/month w/ 10-year balloon

**Unit 2:** 2/3 rented, 1 vacancy. Rents are $900, $900, $900

* Market Rents are $1100/ea (supposedly)
* Purchase: $400k
* Down Payment: $94k
* Seller carry note is $306k 4% int, 30year amort, $1461/month with ***NO Balloon***

&amp;#x200B;

The seller says my offer needs to be: $154k + assignment fee + closing costs

Total purchase $825k

Total monthly payments $2961 and no prepayment penalties.

Then they list ""your offer should include what assignment fee you are willing to pay above the $154k down payment""

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a ""good deal"" and therefore it makes me wonder what I'm missing? Why would you sell a cash-flowing building that's almost 100% rented, AND continue to carry the note for the buyer?

One thing that I’ve been thinking about and not having a clear answer is what to do as the population shrinks… the world population is scheduled to shrink over the next 100 years, in some places it already has. There are states in the US that have been shrinking for a while. To me the underlying idea behind real estate is that they arent making more land but they are making more people so that means you can charge rent for land and housing and that’s held true for centuries. And yet that’s about to change and it’ll reduce demand and continuously reduce demand. The US is already doing it’s part by reducing immigration.

1555,realestateinvesting,Considering a Fixer-Upper? 5 Questions to Ask First,"You want to become a real estate investor, but the only thing you can afford is a fixer-upper.

Your plan is to buy something below market value, make some improvements (maybe while living there), and then rent it out. Long term, you’ll refinance to access the rehab cash, and then either sell it or continue renting it out.

The old [Live-In Flip](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zd2VhdGVxdWl0eS5lbWFpbC9wL2xpdmVpbi1ob3VzZS1mbGlwcGluZy0xMDEiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiYzMyMWJkZDEtNzQ1My00OWRmLTk2OWYtOWZlOGMyMjIyYTk2IiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiIzMTM5YTg3OS02MjM0LTQ1YjQtOTk0NS04M2Q4YTM3OWJmYzAiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImE4N2MzMjQzLWEzZGMtNDI1Yi05MDIwLTFiZDQ4YmM5YTBhOSIsImlhdCI6MTY3NTg1Nzk3OS43OTgsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.QTVDOmHvnvuFVHrKMFOVyigrzo40jg18syojjtb1IHY)!

Sounds like a good plan, right? So, you link up with a realtor and begin touring homes. After visiting a few homes, you find one where the numbers make sense and it seems manageable to fix.

You are ready to make an offer, but then you get cold feet. You have never bought a house before or completed any major renovations. You begin doubting your knowledge, research, and strategy.

* What if I’m not ready?
* What if I screwed up the numbers?
* What if I go over budget on the renovations?

I was once in your shoes, doubting everything. So I scoured r/realestateinvesting and BiggerPockets and developed a list of common questions to ask yourself before making an offer on a fixer-upper, to help give you confidence in your investment.

If you are nervous about buying your first fixer-upper, stop and ask yourself these five questions first.

# 1 - How bad is the house?

Does the home just need some paint? Or does it need to be completely gutted?

The more projects you tackle, the more that can go wrong. For example, replacing a rotting door jamb could turn into replacing three rotting floor joists!

*Speaking from personal experience here!*

Anyways, the point I'm trying to make is that before you pull the trigger on a fixer-upper, you need to understand two things:

1. What projects you will be tackling?
2. How much will those projects cost?

## 2 - Is the project worth your time and money?

Not all fixer-uppers are worth it.

Let's say you have two options.

1. Buy a $120,000 fixer-upper that needs $30,000 in repairs
2. Buy a $150,000 house that needs no repairs

Some investors might immediately think that the fixer-upper is a better deal.

They are wrong.

$120,000 to $150,000 with $30,000 of repairs is really tight. Any projects that are out of scope will break your bank. And there will be projects that are out of scope that will come up.

However, if you could get the same property for $90,000, put $30,000 in, and make it $150,000, that's a different story.

## 3 - Do you have time to devote to renovations?

Whether you plan on doing the work yourself or hiring someone to do it for you, fixer-uppers take time.

If you plan on doing the work you have to plan projects, complete projects, and fix them when they don't go as planned.

If you plan to hire someone to do the work, oftentimes you have to be on-site and make sure the work is being completed correctly.

I didn't understand how much time my fixer-upper would take. From purchase to move-in, I was working 80-hour days: 40 hours at my day job and 40 hours at the house. For four months, I was heads-down, grinding on this property. I had no time for friends, hobbies, or anything else.

So, before you buy a fixer-upper, ask yourself if you actually have the time for one.

## 4 - Do you have the skills needed to manage a renovation?

Most people who buy fixer-uppers plan on doing some of the work themselves. This is a great idea, especially if you plan to buy a few other fixer-uppers in the future.

Completing and managing fixer-upper projects helps you do a few things:

1. Save money on labor
2. Learn the skills needed to get the job done
3. Figure out how much certain projects should cost
4. Understand how long it takes to complete certain projects
5. Determine whether or not you want to tackle certain projects in the future

But even though there are a lot of great benefits to tackling renovation projects, there are a lot of things that could go wrong.

* What if you start a project and realize it’s too much work?
* What if you begin a project and you don’t have the skills to complete it?
* What if your lack of skills actually makes it more expensive to complete the project compared to just hiring someone?

DIYing is a critical aspect of getting your money’s worth on a fixer-upper, but so is understanding where your skill gaps are and hiring qualified contractors when it makes sense.

## 5 - Do you have the determination to persevere when things get difficult?

Fixer-uppers are difficult, especially if you plan on doing a lot of the work on your own. You're going to tackle projects that are going to make you want to pull your hair out. But, you need to have the will to persevere and the motivation to keep going.

### By answering these five questions, you'll have a clearer understanding of whether or not you should pursue that fixer-upper.

If you are thinking about buying a fixer-upper, ask yourself these five questions first:

1. How bad is the house?
2. Is the project worth your time and money?
3. Do you have time to devote to renovations?
4. Do you have the skills needed to manage a renovation?
5. Do you have the determination to persevere when things get difficult?

Buying a fixer-upper can be an extremely rewarding experience, but you need to have the drive to keep going, even when the going gets tough. There is no magic eight ball when it comes to determining which properties to invest in. But by asking yourself the right questions, you can help yourself make a better investment decision.

I’m in Seattle and tired of the cloudy and shady weather from Oct to Mar. I don’t sell my house in Seattle since it’s well appreciated and near good schools. 

Rather I would line to buy a 2nd house in Atlanta (Johns Creek, to be specific). I’m not sure if I’ll live in JC all the time though out the year. If so, I’ll rent the Seattle house for about $4000 and I’m paying $5500 everything included. This is fine because the Seattle one is well appreciated (+800K since the purchase). 

My main question is the 2nd one in JC: if I’m not living in JC but renting out, I think I can only get $3000 for a $800K purchase? which is definitely negative cash flow at todays interest rate (assuming 20% down). 

Is this area good for appreciation in the long run considering no chance for positive cash flow?"

For reference, my mom’s a very prominent real estate agent in this area and my dad worked on the side as a home inspector in his free time for years and has done fire and water restoration all his life, so i have lots of great knowledge and experience around me. 

This is a single family new home, ~$270,000 list price and the builder is offering $10,000 towards closing and 30 yr. fixed rate mortgage at 4.5%. My mom found this deal and with her side of the deal going towards closing costs I’m going to be very little out of pocket to close. I’ve got ~$20,000 liquid cash and ~$13,000 in a brokerage account mainly in a few index funds. I graduate next spring and will very likely be working for the company I co-op with (mechanical engineering/construction firm) and likely be between $65k-$75k salary right after school. Only debt I’ve got is my truck payment (~$400/mo.). 

I threw the numbers I knew in an investment calculator and wound up with a cap rate of about 8.5%, and monthly cash flow of ~$800, which seems quite good to me. 

I’m wondering if this is a good plan, the house will rent for ~$2,400/mo. based on my mom’s comps and my parents have already offered to help me manage it when i am not in town. 

Please let me know if there’s any other information needed, I know I’ll have no issue qualifying for the loan as I have stellar credit and mom has already offered to co-sign, and we plan to place the home in our family’s LLC which already has I believe 2 other properties in it. I’m not 100% sure how this will affect the whole process, so any advice would be great.

And I figure this way I will pass off washer/dryer maintenance to the tenants. I don't have to provide anymore of these machines. They are expensive to maintain because tenants are really rough on them or something.

My house is a 4 bedroom house in a relativly small but growing city in Austria. I bought it for 230K and have now a 195K loan left at a fixed rate of 1,3% for the next 30 years. I can pay the mortage with ease and can also save up more capital without problem and because my mortage is fixed while my wage increases with inflation, at least to a degree, it will hopefully become even more affordable.

I am also starting to improve the house, like I am replacing the oil heating with something else and i hope to renew the roof within the next 3-5 years.

In the same time frame i could also build up extra savings of 20-30K and i would like to maybe buy a small apartment in Vienna if I can find some for about 100K.

I think I could buy such an apartment without needing any extra collateral but I still wonder if having my own house would still be a benefit even with an existing mortage? Because my loan will be smaller by then, yet my house will have more invested in it and will maybe even have appreciated on its own a bit.

Assuming it would have a value of 250K, which is kinda a low estimate i believe, and I could have a mortage of up to 80% of its value i could have an mortage of 200K, but the real loan will be down to like 170K. Could i use this 30K difference for my advantage?"

I could get approximately 250 per month more, but would be out of a renter for 2 months until finished.

We got a steal on the property, 35k off asking. And is turnkey all things considered. I could add some value for sure down the road, but even with the reduced rent we are looking great on cash flow (went extremely conservative) and the property is overall in great condition. Our PM, contractor and REA said we should just take the tenants that are coming in, as they'd be guaranteed and just wait till they moved out to decide if we want to change it. Curious what others would do."

1624,realestateinvesting,Working around super low rental cap in Condo,"We (spouse and I) purchased a 2Bed condo in a community of 31 units with a rental cap of 3 as our primary residence in June 2018. We lived in the condo for almost 4 years, we got pregnant and realized we need more space, so we bought a bigger home and decided to rent the condo. Here's the timeline:22 Nov 2021: Ask HOA management about rental cap and process to rent. Response - only 2 units currently rented, rental cap of 3.15 Feb 2022: Signed contract for new home, asked HOA permission to rent (based on the process and recent info)Response - 3 units currently rented, join wait list.1 Mar 2022: HOA board suggests to apply for hardship exception and get approval to rent for a year instead of trying to increase the rental cap of 10%. No justification of why not increase rental cap. 1 April 2022: Start renting with 1 year exception. #1 on wait list to rent.6 Feb 2023: Ask HOA status of waitlist and when the current 3 units rentals expire.Response - 3 units have decided to rent indefinitely. Make your decision to sell or occupy the unit for Feb 20.We do not want to sell the unit and would like to continue renting. Apart from trying to convince the board and community to increase the rental cap (highly unlikely due to convoluted process and lack of participation from community) what options do we have to continue renting? This is a horrible time to sell as the prices and coming down in our area (Kirkland, WA) a unit was on market for 4 months in our condo before it was sold. Letting the existing owners renting to do so indefinitely seems unfair."
1625,realestateinvesting,Looking for beginner's advice in deal-structuring and if it's viable to begin from scratch in 2023,"I want to start off by saying I've done quite a lot of reading in this sub, searching for ""Beginners advice"" threads and have learned a lot: mostly that it takes money to make money. Now, most of those threads are at least several months to years old. I was not savvy enough to be in position to start buying back when money was cheap and now I'm seeing traditional mortgage rates for 780+ credit at 5.8 - 6.1% :(

Here's where I'm at: **I am not currently a real-estate investor. I have a stable w2 that pays the bills, and a mortgage on my primary home. I feel like I don't want to sit on the sidelines anymore.**

I'd love to get into real estate. I see 2 main routes I could take

\#1) possibly leverage my equity to start the process, using a HELOC to get a down payment together for a rental. My hope would be a multifamily property, maybe a triplex or 4 plex. 

\#2 find an equity partner to get my feet wet and work with someone locally to ""show me the ropes"" so to speak. The partner puts in the money for the down-payment (or I mix in my own money from HELOC)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not here asking for advice on the networking side since I have a few good friends in the industry. It's more that I'm asking about the way to structure deals in these more ""creative"" financing transactions? 

Super generic example: I find a 4-plex for $1mil and convince a partner to put the $250k down and finance the difference in a conventional CRE loan or whatever. Let's say the numbers look good and the property cash-flows nicely and is a ""good deal"" from the #'s perspective.

What would I offer the equity partner to incentivize them to put money in this deal (besides my own charm and passion for the project)? Like what would they want? Surely a 50/50 split would be too generous since they had all the skin in the game? So I'm curious mostly about the way those partner deals are structured?"

1627,realestateinvesting,ROI on inherited house (after mortgage payoff),"Do I use the renovation cost and mortgage payoff as my investment cost. Or the newly appraised value of the home in the ROI formula? 

Should I be looking at cash flow ROI? Debating to rent or sell."
1628,realestateinvesting,Sell or keep investment property?,"So the beginning of this year, I came across a really good deal on a SFH property and decided to buy it. Typically I would have structured this deal a little differently, but it was too good of a deal to let slip. I close on it tomorrow.

I'm now on the fence on whether I should keep it and rent it out, or sell it. Regardless, it was a good deal and I'd be making money on it.. I'm just on the fence on what the better option is as it ties up a lot of my capital.

So I'm purchasing a turnkey property for $100k and taking out a loan of $75k @ 7.175%. My payments would be \~$750, with market rent at $1500. The property was appraised for $175k. I plan to try to rent it out for $1550 and net $800/mo in cashflow.

I would have to bring \~$36k to close. ($25k down payment, \~$5.7k to lender, remaining on your typical closing/insurance/taxes). Additionally, I'd have put in around \~$5k (generous rough estimate) to get it rent ready. Essentially putting myself at an all-in of $40k. 

$40k tied in a property is a lot for me, as I could be BRRRing other properties with this as capital.

Looking back, I'd have done a few things differently. My issue now is that a LOT of money is going to the lenders, and if I refi/sell, I'd have to pay a prepayment penalty of 5% (5-year stepdown).

To get the money out, I'd either have to refi now.. which I'd just be paying the lenders more money in prepayment, in addition to another fee for a different loan.. and my mortgage would be higher making my cashflow nonexistent... or I sell the property, take the loss on the prepayment + whatever costs of the sale... or I keep the property and rent it out and wash my hands of the $40k for \~5 years before I refinance.

What would you do? I'm also asking this for future reference, as I typically deal with BRRR's and not turnkey properties."
1629,realestateinvesting,Sell My Only Property? Possibly to Tenant?,"
Hello everyone,

I am in need of a bit of advise on what to do in my current situation. Back in 2019, I purchased a small town home in a LCOL area for $30,000. It's a 2BD 1 Bath 1080SQFT small place. I put about 7K into fixing it and rented it right away. The property was purchased in a location which I do not live in. (Live in NYC, house was purchased in a small city in PA ~ 4 Hours away).



Ever since I purchased it, the small property has been rented ever since. I haven't had a good experience with it since it has been mostly occupied by family and a tenant that has not been very good. Late last year, I decided to do a formal appraisal and hired a professional to do it for me. Come to find out from the appraisal that my property is worth about $50,000. This was a hell of a surprise to me since I thought it would be about 68-70K as I was counting on Redfin/Zestimate amounts. According the appraiser and also based on the photos shown to me, the house is in pretty bad conditions (messed up cabinets, holes in the ceiling, broken windows, etc). In addition, a more thorough inspections might reveal even bigger problems like roofing issues. The tenant inside is interested in buying it and says he will let me know this coming month if he can go ahead with it. His lease is up in April and I already told him I don't plan on renewing his contract. honestly don't know what to do with this property.


Here are my Numbers:


Income from Rent = $800/m - ($9,600/yr).

Landlord Expenses 


Taxes = 1,871


Trash Pickup = 396


Water Usage = 1,828


Renter's Insurance = 1,084


Repairs = 0




Here are some of my thoughts on whether to sell or not.



Reasons to Keep it:

+ Cash Flow. It has been quite nice to have monthly cash flow coming in. 

+ It is a source of pride. This small property is all I have. I don't really have anything else to my name other than this. I hear friends and people in general saying that they would like to invest in real estate and it's a bit of an ego boost thinking that I already own something.

+ The property is completely paid off. Nothing owed on it since I bought with cash.

+ It can act as form of emergency or backup. Just somewhere to go in case of job loss/illness/etc.

+ Low Taxes? Paying all yearly taxes is just a bit under $2,000 a year.

+ Auto Insurance. I keep my auto insurance associated with my property's address. It dramatically lowers my premiums. I am saving over $100 a month here.




Reasons to Sell it:


- It will be hard to sell it to someone other than my tenant, given that I have to find a broker and sell it on the open market. There will be high fees and the conditions of the house are not good.


- Property is down bad. Fixing it will cost thousands. And to have a person even interested in buying it, this is needed.


- The property is not located where I currently live. It's 4 hours away. I can't keep an eye on it.


- Managing this property has not been fun. I haven't had the best of luck with it. Or maybe I don't have the personality to deal with tenants, contractors, etc. I do not have much experience and I am easy to fool when it comes to this (sob stories, naming contractor prices etc).


- A major reason why selling might be a good options is because I can use the money from the sell, coupling it with some minor savings and maybe I can buy my own primary home for me to live in, have kids w/ wife, raise a family etc. I currently rent in a HCOL city, selling it can give me the opportunity to buy a home somewhere and start fresh.

1680,realestateinvesting,"Thoughts, opinions, criticism…","Hi! Newer investor here looking for feedback.

This example is based in the Midwest.

After 10 years of saving and a lot of analysis paralysis, I purchased my first rental property in May 2022 as a 31st birthday present to myself. It’s currently cash flowing $400/month after all expenses.

I bought my first property (currently living here) in 2019 with intentions of turning it into a rental. The property was purchased at 182k but is currently valuing at $240k+. We’re at 2.7% and I’m confident I could get $600+/month cash flow after all expenses.

I was looking to buy another rental, but with rates and the rising appreciation all around the city, the numbers don’t make sense. It seems more logical to rent out my current home as I initially intended and upgrade to something bigger/nicer as our primary residence.

I put an offer in on a new house for $455k which was accepted. Per the appraisal the property is currently valued at $460k. This would be our new primary residence and I plan on finishing the basement to add more value. The house is located in a neighborhood that’s still being developed (200/600 homes currently built) in a very popular area of town thats expanding rapidly(new Costco going in across the street within 2 years, brand new high school and elementary school in the neighborhood, right next to one of the nicest golf courses in the city) I don’t intend on renting this house in the future but staying for the next 5-10 years and cashing in on the appreciation.

I want to point out I’ll have a roommate in the newer property so my monthly mortgage payment will be similar to what I’m paying now.

Is it a poor choice to upgrade our primary residence and miss out on a potential $50k+ which I could invest elsewhere?"

Don't have strong relationships in the industry so I'm bringing my process here to see what advice you fine folk can give. I have a handful of residential properties and want to transition towards commercial. I look at crexi and loopnet. Scroll through every property within 30 miles of my home. Find a dozen or so that I'd be able to handle like small strip malls or office buildings. Get the P&amp;L which supports the 6% cap rate listing price. Then run the numbers with a loan and it's always red until my down payment is significant. 

A few times I've called the listing agent to feel out what wiggle room there is but it's always firm. Even the 2 properties that have been listed since mid covid are firmly at the same asking price. At this point I'm not sure how to proceed. Do I abandon this area? Do I need to get on the phone with the seller and negotiate? Do I need to suck it up and put the bigger down payment? How does this compare to you folks?"
1683,realestateinvesting,Is it time for an attorney?,"We purchased a property to be a rental last September. The reason we even knew about the property is we saw they had a leveling crew and asked the owners who they were using as we need to level our own house. The rental has an addition in the back, and we noticed in a few months that it started sinking from the original portion of the house. Trim is separating from the ceiling on the side closest to the rest of the house, and a tub on that side now holds water because it's not draining properly. You can also see damage on the wall in the hallway leading to it. We also noticed the first time it rained that someone had added a ton of earth to the small side yard that unequivocally pushed all the rain water to the corner of the house where the addition joined the original house. There are also no gutters (which obviously we knew) so half the water that hit the roof was also falling into the yard and flowing through that one spot. You could clearly see how it was all washing out the foundation. 

We called the foundation company as we were told by the sellers that they had a two year warranty. The foundation company owner told us that the sellers explicitly told him to only level the front of the house because they were selling it and didn't want to pay for the addition. It was advertised to us that the house had been leveled with no implication that the addition portion was not. The inspector caught neither issue, but raved about the foundation, which leads us to believe he didn't check the back. 

We filed a claim with our insurance provider, and they told us that the policy does not cover foundation issues, but recommended that we speak with an attorney because it sounds like the sellers purposely withheld this information and the inspector should have caught it. We are working on the backyard drainage ourselves and already installed drainage to prevent future damage to the foundation and have a quote to repair the back. Is it worth talking to the attorney, or is this just an expensive learning moment?"
1684,realestateinvesting,Never have used hard money loan but I am interested in how the process works with money draws or advances if anyone has done it before.

--‐---------

Background-


Anyway, I am a physician with a spouse who qualifies as a real estate professional for tax purposes.


Plan on ramping up our long-term real estate investing aspirations. Besides the usual benefits of real estate investing (cash flow, equity, appreciation) - the very biggest benefit to us in the short term will be depreciation.


Maximizing depreciation (via section 179 / bonus depreciation before this fully phases out) will help achieve multiple objectives:

- offset my w2 income, ideally completely (substantial given my high marginal tax rate)

- drive down my federal student loan payments to as low as possible via decreased AGI- ideally run out the clock

- ability to reinvest all of these tax/student loan savings into more property 


I understand the need for us to cumulatively materially participate 500 hrs, keep contemporanous notes/time logs, and to group all properties together. 


A bit low on $$ now though, so considering creative ways to acquire properties with relatively little down (subtos, wraps, seller financing) compared to conventional financings. Also plan to do this in as ethical a way as possible - e.g. fully plan to offer applicable federal rates to any seller financing at the very least to assure sellers in a tough position don't get hit with any unforseen tax liability, etc. I also understand the risks with due on sale clauses, the need to fully disclose those risks to sellers and to have back up plans, etc.


As an aside to those who are unaware of subto real estate deals, it is essentially when on purchases a property subject to the exist mortgage (perhaps only paying out of pocket a grand or two to an otherwise underwater or behind seller to allow them to walk away w at least something in their pocket rather than being foreclosed upon).


‐--------------------


More relevant to the main question below-


When reviewing which properties are eligible under section 179 of the IRC, it is noted that eligible property must have been acquired via purchase.


It is further noted that property is not considered acquired by purchase in certain situations, one of which includes if ""it's basis is determined in whole or in part by its adjusted basis in the hands of the person from whom it was acquired.""


----------------------


My main actual question-



For a situation where I am planning to be a buyer in a subto deal (as explained in background above), how exactly is one calculating basis?


Is it meeting the exclusion criteria I had mentioned above, since the original seller's mortgage is still in place?


Or is it indeed eligible for section 179 as the new basis will be determined via how much is actually left on the mortgage that I would be unofficially assuming (plus any other acquisition costs)?


-----------------------------

Secondary question-


If it's a wrap loan, is that secondary loan to seller also considered part of my basis for determining depreciation?"
1705,realestateinvesting,"If I bought a commercially zoned property and it was presumed vacant, would I need liability insurance?","Say I buy a standalone building that is currently a dentist office.

1707,realestateinvesting,How can knowing the seller is doing a 1031 exchange help the buyer?,I saw a 4 plex listed and the description says that the owner is a real estate agent and also that they will be doing a 1031 exchnage. Why would the buy need to know that and does it give them an advantage in negotiation somehow?
1708,realestateinvesting,Talk me out of selling my home in GA and renting for a year (considering move out of state),"Ok so here is the deal, this is my first home and purchased around 2016…Being located in a VERY HOT suburb of Atlanta, I have gained about 170% equity since 2016 and am itching to take profit and run to a rental, maybe in another state or further from the city.

About the home:
-1600sq ft condo/townhouse  in 30188

Reasons to sell:
-Made a great investment and think there might be better deals elsewhere. Simply put take profit and re-up later when conditions improve for buyers.
-Town is subjectively going to shit…Migrants from out of state are hard at work making this quaint little town much like the places they fled from. In short, the town has outgrown itself 
-Will be getting married soon and we both work remote (even prior to 2020), not on top of each other but a few more square feet would help.
-HOA with strict rental restrictions and waitlist to gain rental eligibility. (HOA board members own ALL of the rentals and aren’t leaving any time soon)

 But why a rental my dude?! Well with all of the change and growth around ATL I am considering a move to somewhere a little further from the city, possibly with acreage or maybe even to another state…Myrtle Beach, Asheville NC, Johnson City Tennessee to name a few possible landing zones.  My SO on the other hand is a hard no on selling to only move into a rental and can’t get past the idea of living in a rental and having to move again later but at the end of the day I pay the bills and can live with the doghouse for a while if undermining her is necessary. Kind of a rant here but just wanted to be sure I am not going crazy by thinking it is a good idea to sell and then rent somewhere while we figure out the next place to call home. 

All thoughts, opinions and suggestions are appreciated!"

1711,realestateinvesting,Increasing your customer base &amp; simplifying real estate transactions - Game changer new solution for REI,"Hi REdditors, *tl;dr: We want to make your life (job) easier and make you more money with our new platform. Interested? Let us know a few details about your business needs through our market research questionnaire.*

Last year, we did a write-up on the SEO strategy used by Investor Carrot to rank hundreds of REI websites nationally (Read the Investor Carrot SEO analysis on our blog: [Investor Carrot Websites Review: Conflict of interest?](https://outrank.website/blog/investor-carrot-seo-review/)). Having previously launched several multi-million dollars businesses in this space, we've kept a close eye on the industry as a whole while looking for opportunities to break into the heavily crowded search results.

After careful market research, feature requests &amp; audience targeting, we're aiming to build a real estate facilitator marketplace, which can help both sides of real estate transactions save time, costs and simplify the whole procedure from the get-go. This platform will also provide a great way for burgeoning REIs to break into the industry by lowering the barrier to entry and building the whole operational structure in one place.

**Why the market needs a Real Estate Facilitator**

The real estate market is constantly evolving and becoming more complex, making it difficult for both consumers and real estate professionals to navigate. A real estate facilitator platform can bridge this gap by providing a one-stop-shop for all real estate needs, allowing both consumers and real estate investors or agencies to achieve their goals more efficiently.

For consumers, a real estate facilitator platform can provide access to a wide range of properties, including those not listed on traditional real estate websites. This can be particularly beneficial for buyers looking for unique properties or those in specific geographic locations. The platform can also provide resources such as mortgage calculators, home value estimates, and neighborhood information to help buyers make informed decisions. Additionally, the platform can connect buyers with experienced real estate professionals, such as agents and home inspectors, to guide them through the buying process.

For real estate investors and agencies, a real estate facilitator platform can provide increased visibility and lead generation. By listing properties on the platform, investors and agencies can reach a wider audience and attract more potential buyers. The platform can also provide analytics and other tools to help investors and agencies track their listings and monitor their performance. This can help them make more informed decisions about their properties, such as when to list, price, and market them.

A real estate facilitator platform can also benefit consumers and real estate professionals alike by streamlining the buying and selling process. By providing a centralized location for all real estate transactions, the platform can simplify communication and paperwork, making it easier for both parties to complete a sale. For example, the platform can provide a secure location for sharing documents and signing contracts electronically, eliminating the need for in-person meetings. This can save time and money for both consumers and real estate professionals.

Another key benefit of a real estate facilitator platform is that it can provide more accurate pricing information for buyers and sellers. The platform can use data from previous transactions and other market indicators to provide more accurate home value estimates. This can help sellers price their homes more competitively, and buyers can make more informed offers.

In conclusion, the market needs a real estate facilitator platform to bridge the gap between consumers and real estate professionals and make the buying and selling process more efficient. By providing access to a wide range of properties and resources, connecting buyers and sellers with experienced professionals, and streamlining the process, a real estate facilitator platform can benefit both consumers and real estate investors or agencies. The platform can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions and achieve their goals more efficiently, while also providing increased visibility and lead generation for real estate investors and agencies. By providing more accurate pricing information, transparency, and security, it will be a game-changer in the real estate industry.

**Why this is important (&amp; highly profitable) for Real Estate Investors &amp; Agencies**

- Automated follow-ups, e-mail &amp; SMS communications with the customer

Bought my first property,"I've been a lurker in the real estate investing space for years and after a divorce that lead to selling my house at the top of the market and walking away with $55K in profit, I knew one day I'd use it for a down payment on a new place.

I found a modest 1 bedroom 1 bathroom end of row home for $150K in a major city with a medium cost of living and close to a park and a bunch of new development, I'll put 20% down and buy it as a primary residence to live in for a year while I get it renovated and cleaned up. It needs minimal cosmetic work but I'll put in about $15-20K and some sweat equity to update it to a more modern look and make it easier to rent out to a young professional.

The unit should rent for around $1500/mo when all is said and done and the mortgage will be around $1100 per month. If I pay it down a little aggressively while living there over the next year and then refi once the rate drops by 1% or more, then I should be able to get the mortgage down to $1K flat.

However, I just found out today that he has NO understanding of basic investment concepts like the Cap rate. I told him the cap rate used by seller to arrive at the asking price is too low (because interest rates have sky-rocketed so cap rate has to go up too), and he gave me a response that showed me that he has zero fundamental understanding of investment math. 

I don't need him to be an investment wizard because I'm quite comfortable with working out the numbers on my own. However, I feel like he's going to be working against me instead of with/for me. I tried to explain to him how Cap rates work earlier and he just insisted on his understanding, then ignored my last message attempting to explain. 

I'm traveling out of state for the viewings in the next few days so there probably isn't enough time to fire and re-hire. Plus, I feel terrible that he has already done a lot of work.

1739,realestateinvesting,Should I Open a Business Bank Account,"Hello! Hoping to get some advice from anyone with more experience than myself! 

We currently have two properties that we are renting out. We've been renting out the first one for about 8 months and will begin to rent the second out in the next few months. Since the very beginning, I've kept the ""business"" finances separate. While I use USAA for all personal accounting, I have a separate ""personal"" Chase account with two different checking accounts that is used for everything related to the properties.

I've been looking into converting the ""personal"" Chase account into an actual ""Business"" account with them (it made sense in my head) but the benefits actually seem negligible. The benefits of the business account is the ability to pay employees, give employee credit cards, accept credit payments, etc. which are all things I'm not doing. 

In your opinion, do you think there would be a benefit to opening up an actual business account? It seems the only important thing is to actually keep the finances separate which I am already doing effectively. Open to any and all advice, though! Thank you in advance!"

1756,realestateinvesting,Take a risk?,"So we are looking at an interesting investment property. It's around $300k and is a 10k sq ft lot with one existing portable tiny home (2021 model, really nice, sleeps 4) and brand new deck/pergola. Water and power onsite already. They have plans for a 2 bd septic, but that is not present today. There are also 2 additional RV hookups, that just need a little land work to level them out. Super high summer recreation community on a big river with pool, tennis, etc. Lot is not waterfront, but 5 blocks away. The tiny home was renting for $350/night on summer weekends, but I think it could do higher (let's say $400/night) and require a 3 night minimum for peak season. RV spots $50-100/night each when complete is my estimate.  So let's assume $500/night, 3 nights a week, for 16 weeks = $24,000 for summer season. Off season, I have no consistent data for comps, so let's say $0 and assume that $24,000 is our annual revenue. We would also potentially use this property ourselves, as it's 2 hours from home and we have an RV. Running the numbers with standard assumptions and trying to be pretty conservative, it would have some cashflow, albeit pretty low like 2-3% CoC return. However, I'm pretty confident in the area's ability to perform and with the option to eventually move the tiny home to one of the RV spots and build another house onsite seems like there is some more upside. Does this seem like too big of a risk as a vacation/investment move or could have real potential? This would be my first investment/vacation property personally, but I've watched my dad do it for the past 30+ years so I'm not completely new to it."

The previous buyer’s financing fell through, he then recommended me the property and told me it had appraised for 20k more and therefore it’s listing price of 220k was fair. When it came time for my lender to appraise it, they appraised it for 220 on the dot.

When I asked him about it this was his response: 

“Appraiser usually just appraise it for the purchase price. About 90% of appraisals come in at the purchase price. All the lender wants to know that it’s worth the loan amount. I mean it’s not a coincyndance that the value came in to the penny of the purchase contract.

Last appraisal was 240k but it’s a different appraiser. Human Element.

10 appraisers 

7-8 would come in at purchase price. Other 2-3 would be wild cards.

They want the value to cover the loan and that’s all they care about”

1783,realestateinvesting,Adirondack Waterfront &amp; Mountain area STR,"Hi All,

This is a little nuanced so bear with me. 

I purchased a late 1800’s lakefront Adirondack property in July 2021 with two other family members. Father and soon to be brother-in-law. We all have a great relationship. We’re 1/3 owners, tenants in common. 

Major renovations were needed and we’re doing the work ourselves. My father and grandfather owned a large construction business and have the know how. We are doing everything the right way and not cutting corners. Most of all materials were purchased at the time of house closing. 

Renovations needed and completed were as follows: 
1. replaced all electrical work and added additional lighting. 
2. Insulation to crawlspaces and winterized all plumbing. 
3. All new plumbing. Added water filtration system in lieu of drilling for spring water as neighbors had to drill about 800 feet.  
4. Added mini splits and baseboard heat. 
5. Mold remediation. 
6. Rip and replaced 1 of 2 bathrooms.
7. New custom hand crafted windows to fit Adirondack style house. 
8. Cut dangerously close/dead trees
9. Kitchen is gutted and ready for remodel. 
10. Added dehumidifier and drainage system for basement
11. New gravel driveway

Projects still needed to be done:
1. 2nd bathroom replaced (demo is done). 
2. Install deck (materials already purchased). 
3.  Paint exterior and fix some siding (small amount of work). 
4. Demo shitty screened in ex owner DIY porch and replace with sunroom. 
5. Minor repair to foundation. 
6. Sand and seal floors 
7. Sand and finish interior cedar walls/ceilings
8. Add hot tub and sauna. 
9. Updates to the boathouse. 

Purchase price: $600k
Equity:$215k mostly from a 1031 from my father. 
Interest on the remaining: 3.9%
Appraisal was $725k at the time of purchase. 
Dollars spent on the project to date: $100k
Added value so far: Depending on who’s looking anywhere from $200-300k. 
Monthly cost for the mortgage as a 1/3 owner: $1730/Mo
Labor cost per month: $1430. 


The building is a 2 bed 2 bath with boathouse 2 acres and similar finished properties are going for just north of $1M. 

STR’s in the area rent for about $400-500 a night peak season. Memorial Day to Labor Day. 

MAJOR ISSUE IS: The town is proposing a law that will limit STR’s to 90 days a year with many stipulations and hoops to jump through making it extremely difficult to manage and turn a profit. Had this been a known thing at the time of purchase we wouldn’t have bought it. 

The numbers don’t make sense anymore with the new law and we’re not done renovation. I know this land will increase in value regardless of what the market does since it’s a great piece of land in a highly desired location. 

Money aside, my father is in love with the property but I don’t want to be bleeding money to hold a property only because he loves it. This has been his dream since he was 19. If this doesn’t make money it severely impacts my goals of obtaining other real estate as this is my first property. 

I’m unsure whether to push to sell unfinished, finish the reno then sell, or bleed money and see my goals move extremely slow. 

Looking for advice on what other possibilities there are, and other comments on this predicament.  I’m sure there’s details I’ve missed but this is what I think is most of it. 


TL/DR: purchased a property in a great location with family, it’s an unfinished project. New law makes the numbers not work for STR. Not sure whether to sell now, sell after the reno, or hold and bleed money. Also looking for other ways make this situation better."

1790,realestateinvesting,Primary residence swapping?,"Looking for advice. Going to try to get to the jist of it. 

I have a house I bought cheap in cash to remodel.
I’m currently living in it during the remodel and living in it is kinda slowing the remodel down. I’m doing the work myself. 
I want to buy another house to live in to finish remodeling my primary residence. (No shower, no kitchen, no furnace, it’s rough).
I want to gain equity and future cashflow later on with this other house instead of renting an apt for the meantime. 
I want to use the second house as a primary residence to put as little down as possible and use the rest of my cash reserves for the remodel instead of putting 20%down. 
I then want to move back into my remodeled house after fulfilling the owner occupancy loan requirements for a year on the second house. 

My question is, are there any issues with changing your primary residence to another property and then back to the original primary residence?

The second house is technically a tiny home that has been remodeled and is fully furnished with brand new appliances. It’s an old home with a decent yard and garage. It belongs to my realtor and he is looking to sell with everything included in the house. Essentially, it could be rented out or used as an airbnb right away without any effort.

1795,realestateinvesting,Seller financing questions,"I had a few questions about seller financing I was hoping to have answered. Pretty new to RE so don’t assume I know anything please.

I have been looking at a house I would like to buy listed around 400k in a 10/10 neighborhood. Catch is it is absolutely a dump. It has many issues from cosmetic, to water/mold stains and a possible foundational issue. The owner is offering seller financing which I’m assuming is because a bank won’t approve a loan for the amount they want to sell it for because it’s in rough shape. The house has dropped in price a few times now and been on the market for maybe 3 months or so. There have only been two owners, one who lived in it for many years and the most recent owner who it looks like bought it to try and quick flip but realized just how much work it was going to be.

 In this context do you think it would be possible to get favorable seller financing terms?

I was reading most seller financing situations have higher interest rates or other unfavorable terms because the buyers can’t get a loan due to bad credit or other reasons. But since that is not the case here and it seems like the sellers just want to cut their losses how likely would it be to get a very low interest rate (3-4%) via seller financing?

Also any other informations would be appreciated.

TLDR: can you lowball interest rates in seller financing in a run down home the seller is trying to wash their hands of?"

So I purchased it (separate from the business) about 18 months ago and set up the NNN Lease (my business leases the building from me).  This was how my accountant recommended I do it and so I did.  Ever since, I have been wondering a few things...

&amp;#x200B;

Mostly I want to know how the business paying the property taxes on my behalf does not equate to some form of income for me.  Similarly, any building repair or improvement - that benefits me directly as the owner, and potentially increases the value of the real estate, so how is it also not some kind of income?  As an even clearer example, I am considering a building remodel which will add new office space and increase the useable square footage.  That will most definitely increase the building value separate from the business.  Yet the business is footing the bill and I personally benefit...

1849,realestateinvesting,possible to have a developer build on property but still own the land?,"This isn't something in the works for me right now, but I would love to someday have a small rental building built on my land.

For example, could I buy a plot of land which I own 100% then have a developer build say, a duplex or fourplex on it, then rent out the units and repay the developer over time OR have the developer and I split the monthly rental profits?   


the main reason that I'm thinking of this speculative method is that I can forseeably afford land quite easily, but funding a multi-unit home or small building would be tough. HOWEVER, rental income would pay the mortgage/building costs once it's up and running. I'd love to hear people's thoughts!"

My mother has some apartments here, in Southern Italy (detail I want to share because I assume most of you live in the US), but she has been scared by the hypothesis that people won’t pay for the rent, because this happened once and it was a big mess to cope with (police, lawyers…). 

Now she’s asking for warranties (proof of income) by the “applicants” but we still haven’t rented the apartments yet, even if the price is pretty reasonable for the city and the zone.

Any suggestions?

1875,realestateinvesting,AirBnB or rent it out?,"Hello, long-time lurker, first time poster. I inherited roughly 500k last April and immediately bought (with cash) the house directly behind my current home for 289k. Both homes are paid for. This house, which is situated in a cul-de-sac, was the armpit of the neighborhood but the houses surrounding it are very nice, 450-500k homes. I have fixed it up on my own, only paying for specialized stuff such as plumbing, electrical and such thus my total renovation costs have been relatively low. The house is 1680sf and is a 4 bed, 2 bathroom. I live in a town which boasts 3 major hospital systems so I know that traveling healthcare workers are always looking for a place to live. I'm wondering if I should AirBnB this home or rent it out? Any recommendations or advice would be much appreciated."

1878,realestateinvesting,Sell or keep? Southern California,"I bought a triplex 3 years ago during Covid for 2.3M. It’s three blocks away from the beach, in a very desirable coastal town. I had do 30% down because the banks were very cautious in lending. I had rolled over some proceeds from another sale into a 1031 and bought this property.

Refinanced it when the interest rates were low and fixed the tenants and increased the cash flow in these three years. Here are the numbers today

Rents - $10300/ month, investment 700k, equity ~700k, property value ~3M. 

Current income just about covers mortgage, property management, insurance and taxes with a couple thousand per year left for repairs. I bought this property as a part of diversifying my investments under an LLC. I learnt getting the equity out is not as simple as a HELOC.

1881,realestateinvesting,High-cost metropolitan real estate investing? Worth taking the plunge?,"Looking to get into real estate investing as a supplemental source of income and to move myself away from relying on the corporate world for a paycheck.

Situation: Live in a very high-cost metropolitan area that has experienced double digit pricing growth over past \~5 years. Currently own a 2 bed 2 bath apartment, purchased in April 2021 for $1M with $200k down at 1.54% fixed for 5 year term. Have \~$760K remaining and am able to manage monthly payments very well given me and my partner’s combined incomes. Should have no issues with payments even at much higher rates (6-7%+) when renewal comes around in 3 years.

I have been very lucky because the company I work for went through an IPO and I was given a significant chunk of equity. That equity is currently valued at around $400k and pays a dividend yield of \~2%, about $8k per year. This is held in a non-registered account so any sale of shares would be taxed, as are the dividends.

If I were to purchase a good quality 1 bed, 1 bath apartment in my home city it would likely cost somewhere around $400-500K. Could rent it out at $2,200-2,500 per month depending on the situation. After mortgage costs, the building's maintenance fees, etc I likely would not break even on a monthly basis and may even need to put a few hundred $ per month into the apartment to cover the delta in costs. At this point I would consider it a liability rather than asset.

My question for reddit is whether it makes sense to sell some of these shares to get into real estate investing or just to hold. On the surface my returns are significantly better with the shares, but the power of leverage in a city where prices will likely continue to rise, and my desire to start accumulating hard assets and move away from the corporate world, has me thinking the grass is greener."
1882,realestateinvesting,Today I reached my goal of 20k/month in cash flow!,"Obligatory: This is not a brag, I just really wanted to tell someone who can relate and hopefully celebrate with me. Most of my family and friends have a 9-5 job and don’t really understand what it’s like to have your own business or let alone be in real estate.

About me:

I’m in my early thirties, we’re recently married with a 1 year old and a baby on the way. We live in Seattle and I dropped out of medical school to pursue my career in real estate investing. (Yup I have an idea on what some of you are going yo say :)) I’ve always wanted to be in real estate - I always found it really fun and fascinating and exciting.

How I started:

My first purchase was a SFR in Indiana, I bought it for 26k all-cash with all the money I have saved up. That…was not good. It had every problem I couldn’t even imagine. Stolen copper wires, leaking hearer, etc I didn’t know what I was doing and it took me about 3 months to fix it up and get a tenant in there. I slowly picked my self up, worked hard to make more money and took the plunge to buy another property. 

Fast forward to where I am now:

I currently own 34 units and am going to expand to 50 this year. All the properties are excellent cash flowers and I’m almost completely hands off, except for a few weekly things. I’m really happy, and that’s something I am really proud to say. 

How I got here:

Honestly, people like you got me here. I mean that I soaked up up every bit of knowledge from this forum, and from any other sources I can find. I failed a lot, and learned tremendously from mistakes. So I just want to extend a heart felt thank you to everyone who ever posts, comments, or takes the time to reach out. You guys allow for someone like me to move forward.

Tools I use:

Reddit - general knowledge, motivation 

BiggerPockets - locality based questions

DoorProfit - finding and analyzing deals

Real estate agents - they’re a wealth of information when it comes to making a good decision 

My wife (not a tool lol) - support, motivation, understanding, love.

Where I’m headed:

I’m hoping to have 100 units in the next 3 years with 50k in cash flow / a month. I’d like to start traveling and maybe open my own coffee shop as a hobby. 

I once again want to thank everyone who has helped me on this journey, y’all are amazing!"

1884,realestateinvesting,[FL] Would you rent for one more year or sell before having to pay capital gains tax?,"I have great tenants, but they bought a house so will not be renewing their lease which expires at the end of March. I'm renting out my former primary residence and have two more years to sell without having to pay capital gains tax (5 yr rule). I'm seven hours away from the property so I'm not looking to keep being a landlord forever. Problem is, it produces about $750 in profit each month after costs (I manage it) and I have a 2.75% interest rate on the mortgage. I would have rented it easily for another year if the tenants were staying another year, but I don't want to risk getting in the situation of signing a bad tenant then not being able to evict them in time to sell it.

What would you do - sell now (before a potential recession but high interest rates) or rent another year and sell then (potentially lower interest rates for buyers and more competition, but greater likelihood of a recession)? Thanks for any insight you have!"

1899,realestateinvesting,Question about an REO purchase,"Hi! New investor here, I'm looking at a local foreclosure opportunity and had some questions as I'm not that experienced with REOs.

So I was surprised to learn that a homeowner can cure a loan at any point during the sale, and even up to a year after the sale in some states to reclaim the property.

I was wondering if this is something I could use to my advantage though, here's the situation -

So a homeowner defaulted a $125k mortgage for a house worth roughly $200k, so the bank took over and is listing it for market value and won't budge. No investors want it because there's no equity in the deal and no homebuyers want it because it's a beat up REO.

Now my question is, although at this stage I can't prevent a foreclosure on the owner's record unfortunately, could I still arrange a contract to pay off his $125k mortgage and then purchase the property from him for like $25k?

The difference for them of course is they at least get to walk away with some equity in this situation, vs the alternative of just losing the property outright and empty-handed.

I'm still going to consult my attorney but would love to see if there's anyone who's done a similar transaction before and can give some insight. I'm in Virginia for reference. 

All tips and input greatly appreciated, thanks!"

I’ve hit my limited resources limit and really can’t accept that there is no way out of this

My mother in law bought herself property in Texas 15 years ago. A lady on the area was splitting land out and selling it to people in town. She had bad credit and limited resources but a dream and bought herself 10 acres for 50 something thousand dollars. 

She saved up, sacrificed, put in work, bought a trailer got septic set up and now lives in her trailer retired and comfortable (she owes 31k on the trailer.)

 I’ve just recently learned that because it’s not on cement its not refinance able with the land. 

So this puts a retired woman with fair credit and limited income with her manual labor having husband in a pickle if we want them to ever be able to pay this off. 

Are there resources, financing tools for people in these situations? I’m hoping maybe a loan can get her out of the land loan long enough to save up and put this place on a real foundation.

Back story: Received a USDA loan about 1.5 years ago, got 2.5% interest rate. Live about 20-25 mins from town (population of this town is about 75k). Current mortgage is $1300. Avg rent for similar home is around $1k right now — but this house is quite nice compared to other rentals. 

My concern is if I want to try and rent the home in the future - I don’t think I will have much margin.. or that I could find someone willing to pay 1400-1500 to rent the home.

Our house is a remodeled century home in a desirable suburban area, walking to schools/train/suburban downtown.

We were thinking of either:  
1. Renting it out (our mortgage is 4400, house could rent for 5000-5200) and buying a townhouse in the city (we've already scoped out the area and have stayed there numerous times). Selling is a last resort as we could be due to lose a substantial amount with selling fees + buyers market. 

2. Buying a 1-2 bed condo and hopefully finding something we can airbnb on the side. Way less expensive, we can keep our house, and then a trial run + investment for living in this city (we moved states).

Does anyone have any thoughts? I met with a real estate agent that also offers services to find tenants (for one months rent) and he gave me the rental estimate based on recent homes, but he's so pushy and keeps mentioning timing to sell it, which is our last resort.

I'm going to meet with a property manager to try and get some info around types of tenants and how easy it is to get a home rented. Ideally we could just find tenants ourselves and skip the fee.

Seven most important take aways from this development:

1. There is a home DIRECTLY NEXT DOOR that sold a couple months after the defendant's appraisal. It supported his value.
2. The ""whitewashed"" appraisal was 6 (SIX!) months after Shane's appraisal.
3. The ""whitewashed"" appraiser didn't use that sale as a comp!
4. The homeowner knew about this sale and still went forward with his lawsuit!
5. The homeowner is a Professor of RACIAL DISCRIMINATION and wrote a book about redlining.
6. The defendant had a comp on the 4-6 lane extremely busy street (Northern Parkway) in Baltimore that the plaintiff's live on and have their front door facing. The ""whitewashed"" appraisal didn't have a comp on Northern Parkway and made a miniscule adjustment for the subject property for busy street.
7. It is not known if there were failed ""whitewashed"" experiments that never saw the light of day between the two reports that didn't support the homeowners narrative of discrimination."

1944,realestateinvesting,how to buy cash deals utilizing various sources of credit as a first time investor?,"

TLDR: I'm trying to obtain credit sources (besides for %0 credit cards), that are possible to obtain without having to prove income or assets, to use for purchasing cash RE deals. If anyone has any info on specific banks/financial institutions or just any general advise or info on how to accomplish this, thank you.



Basically me and a friend are trying to get into real estate ownership for the long term benefits of owning cash flowing properties. The type of deals I'm looking at buying are off market properties that have a value add opportunity to them (usually vacant stuff that will need some but not major reno), and the plan is to cash out refi once all units are occupied with quality tenants and the property is stabilized and cashflowing. 

The thing is we don't really have any significant money of our own right now, so we need a way to find funding sources to buy these deals. 

My fico is around 760 right now, and I have around 50k in available credit across 8 personal credit cards which are reporting to the bureaus and my utilization on that is usually between %2-%5 depensing on the month. I have %100 on time payment history, 0 late payments and zero other adverse things. My total credit age is 2 years and 9 months. The only thing I don't have is diverse types of credit because I only have credit cards and no auto or student loans or anything like that. So in terms of good credit I think I'm ok. 

But the problem is I don't have good proof of income because I pretty much get paid in cash for my day job and my 2 side hustles are also off the books and no real way to prove income.

But, I have right now about 15 business credit cards (most of them from amex) which I applied for as a sole prop ""business"" (my business name is the same as my name, so it just says my name twice on the cards). These cards do not report to personal bureaus, so I can have high utilization on them without it affecting my credit. These cards were obtained with purely stated figures of income and revenue, and zero proof of anything is required. Some of these biz CC's are at %0 interest on purchases (totaling about 30k available at %0 for periods ranging from 5 months left to 14 months left). and I know how to liquidate that available credit into cash for either free or very low fees while running it thru as ""purchases"" thus avoiding paying any cash advance fees or interest to utilize that credit. 

So we are targeting an all in cost of about 120-150k for our first deal. This includes purchase price + closing costs + reno costs + 6 months of reserves for taxes, insurance, and some other expenses. (We are looking at small deals in areas like Philly, Trenton, Wilmington, Baltimore etc.. so that's why the low purchase price)

So theoretically I would entirely use %0 business credit cards to buy our deal, but at this point in time I can't really accumulate the required amount in credit while running it the way I'm running it with stated income etc, so I need to find additional sources of credit that I can also obtain without proving any income or furnishing tax returns and things like that.

The type of deals I want to buy I can technically also buy with hard money, but as a first timer and doing it with a no doc shop, I'd be looking at extraordinarily high rates, so high that I may as well use business credit cards that are not at %0 and pay CC interest. Which if doing that, then I forsure have enough available credit to buy a deal in my price range, but obviously I don't want to do that. So I'm looking for credit sources that don't have almost mafia level interest. Say %13 or less. 

Is it theoretically possible to obtain a business LOC in this manner? Let's say I create an LLC and then open a business checking account under that LLC at a small local community bank or CU, and then I regularly deposit large sums of cash into the account and maintain a large balance. Will that bank be likely to give me (well, my LLC to be precise) a LOC or some other form of credit just based on the checking account relationship without having to prove income or show balance sheets or tax returns or crap like that? (Obviously with a PG, I'm not expecting to obtain non recourse debt with a fake business). 

Or is it better to try this with bigger national banks? Basically if anyone can advise me on specific financial institutions that are easy to obtain capital from to use for RE purchases without having to have a real business or prove anything that's basically what I'm looking for. Thanks guys!"

1948,realestateinvesting,FHA for first rental,"Howdy,

I’ve been interested in starting my real estate portfolio. I currently have no mortgage payment, however I do have a total of $40K in debt with my vehicle note and student loans. I make about $70K a year.

I’ve been doing research on financing options that can help me get started. I have about $15K saved up but I will want to save an additional $20K by the end of this year. The reason for this would be to pay off my student loans before acquiring any new debt. I’m waiting to hear the outcome of student relief court hearing this year. 

I’ve been looking into FHA loans and read that this is a common way to get started when building your real estate portfolio. Typically people will rent out rooms, live in the home for a year, then refinance other known as house hacking.

I have ton of questions regarding this:

I’ve heard of cap rate, but how do y’all gather accurate expenses when looking at property’s?

How difficult is it to purchase a house with FHA? 

When you live in it for a year and refinance it, is it smart to move to a conventional loan? If so, what should I consider?

I have other questions but these are the 3 main questions I have. Thanks in advance."

I’m thinking…. Would it be better for me to buy a single family home for maybe about 600K which would probably get me a better neighborhood too, find one with a large lot and just add a 800 square foot ADU in the back which are about 200K.
I understand permits and everything need to be involved but long term Id still get my two units that probably are in better condition for the price.

1955,realestateinvesting,Would you go through?,"Hi - consider buying a small apt to get a foot in the door in a market I don’t know (another country) where I have personal connexions. The apt would be rented medium term to students by the room.

Found a property for 100K, total cost would be 130K with taxes and rehab work. Conservative yearly revenues estimates (net of property management commissions and opex) : 10K. So rate of return is 7.7%, before tax (a whopping 40-50% in my country - though rehab work and interest are tax deductible).

I would most likely pay half of it cash, and take a 3-4% loan for the remaining amount (don’t need it but for leverage).

Before you tell me I would get better returns with t-bill or on the stock market, that’s not the case in my country (if only for tax reasons).

Would you consider such returns or not a chance? I am not gonna lie, this may seem like a low return considering what I read here but it is quite high in my market… 

Other option would be to wait for a better opportunity, that may or may not come shortly. I would only lose the 1K I wired to « book » the property (a local practice)."

1960,realestateinvesting,Rent out updated SFH?,"My partner and I bought a SFH in the suburbs last summer. We bought at top of the market (ugh) for 850k. It's in the most desirable suburb in the state, walking distance to train station, suburb downtown (with a bunch of bars/restaurants/shops), and to all schools. So a great location.

The house itself is a fully renovated century home. Interior and exterior look great. In a historic district neighborhood.

We bought it with the intention of being a ""forever home"" that we'd grow into when ready to have kids, but I'm not happy in the suburbs, and want to go back closer to the city.

For selling - I have no idea what it would go for. Last year, similar homes were selling for this closet to this price. Only one house has sold or been listed in the past 6 months that has been comparable, and based off that we could be looking at a 50k loss just on listing price, but it's hard to say. Homes in this area don't seem to sell too often.

For renting - we got some basic comps, and could get 5000-5200 for it. There are bigger homes that have rented for 6000-7000. Our mortgage is 4400, and we put 20% down. If we moved into the city, we'd be within an hour away. I am nervous as it's an older home and it is rather nicely redone. Worried about problem tenants or damage to the house.

I was thinking we could rent it out for a few years, and see how it goes. And then potentially sell it off in the future if it's a hassle or when the market recovers. If renting goes well and it would be better for future kids, maybe freshen it up and move back in 7-10 years. Being in the suburbs, I worry about finding tenants (which would be a family). If you're going to pay this much, and have the required 2-3x income to rent, why not just buy a place?

Has anyone done this with a nicer home before? Selling seems like a last resort, and we could stay for another year or so and hope for a market recovery, but I'm extremely unhappy and isolated here."

In the mean time, if I have 500$ to invest per month (conservatively) would I be best applying that to my mortgage principal, investing in Roth, investing in a brokerage (so that I have some liquid capital) 

My best argument for the mortgage principal is that I’ll have a lot more equity in a few years so my rate per month could be refinanced significantly down and it would cash flow better.

Lets say you find some really,really great deal when buying and knock that down to approximately 30 years. Still does not seem like best idea for me personally.  
Assuming property price will go up is also questionable since population is shrinking.

I’m pretty new to REI. I have two rentals under my belt and 1 flip. I have an opportunity to buy an off market property in downtown Raleigh, NC in an up and coming downtown neighborhood. I’d love to make it a rental but I can’t seem to make the numbers work. I would love to have some feedback. Obviously some of the numbers are ranges and estimates. I’ve only had a few hours to process this and I plan to make an offer by Wednesday.

Flip Scenario
House: 4 Bedroom / 1.5 Bath / 1,350 sqft
Purchase Price: $235,000
Renovation Cost: $40,000-$50,000
ARV: $380,000-$390,000
Financing: Hard money, Equity LoC, $20k cash

Rental Scenario
Market Rent: $1,750-$1,850
Tax: $1,650/year
Insurance: $800/year
Expenses:  $1,500/year
Mortgage Terms: 7.5%, 30 year fix
Mortgage monthly Payment: $1,678


Obviously looking at the above #s there is no way in hell I can make this cash flow at the current mortgage rate I found. I’m searching for a better option like maybe an ARM. But even at lower rates in the 6’s it doesn’t make sense. I also, tried getting owner financing but the seller really wants to cash out. 

My question is, how are people doing BRRR in HCOL areas, especially with rates being what they are? I would argue that Raleigh is still pretty affordable. And historically these rates are still low. 


Am I missing something or do I just need to continue looking for off market properties in the $100k-$150k range with lower renovation costs and higher rent income opportunities? Or Is there another way to approach this?

I tried to get pre approval with the same bank that issues the LLC loan and they couldn’t give me as much pre approval as I wanted due to the LLC debt they have issue to us - even though the 5 units bring in 2.9x the PITI. Seemed odd to me and I have challenged it. But now my question is - since this is an LLC, can’t I just apply at another bank and not disclose it? It doesn’t report to my personal credit and is not on any tax returns yet. Not trying to do anything illegal and also confused why the high income and low expenses on the LLC rentals didn’t wipe the debt obligation with the last bank…? 
They claimed DTI too high.

Hello all,

Just bought my first house. Plan on holding forever at this point. I'm putting quite a bit of work into it at the moment while I'm staying here (upstairs gut, adding half bath upstairs, flooring in kitchen and bathroom, new handrail, paint, caulk ect. ect.). I was wondering how an appraiser would know if my property went up in $XX amount of dollars in the next few years when I go to possibly refinance? The goal is to use this property as collateral for a bigger property Apartment when I.R go low again in next decade maybe. The biggest concern is apparently banks do their appraisals strictly online according to online sources. I found this very odd and kind of concerning for my game plan at this house.

This leads me to my next question, which is - Is ""flipping"" the only true way to receive an honest amount of equity from home improvement projects?

* First-time home buyer
* I sent in an offer for a very small 1 BR in a very good city (Tampere) and a good area. The city is growing / popular and the area has a good reputation. I have never lived in the city before though, so it would entail moving to a new city.
* I work remotely, so not tied by my work
* The apartment is affordable for my income level. Monthly payment would be about 1/6 of my take-home income.
* I should close on the purchase tomorrow. If I back out, there is a 4000eur (4000usd) fine
* I made a mistake with the offer because of FOMO and did not check out the apartment enough before putting in the offer.
* I went to see it again after putting in the offer and found issues that might have put me off making an offer if I had been aware of them
   * The balcony gets some background noise from a highway on the other side of the lake
   * The apartment doesn't get enough daylight because of the angle of the house
* I'm having second thoughts. I feel like I'd rather like to stay in my current town which is smaller and does not have so much going on. But I could afford a much larger home here for the same amount of money. 
* But I feel bad about backing out because I'd lose 4000eur. I'm afraid I'd also regret backing out later."

2035,realestateinvesting,High rates making it hard to reinvest right now?,"I'm sitting on some equity that could be reinvested, most of it gained through COVID appreciation. I have 2 loans that could be refinanced, but they average a 4% rate. If I refi'd to 7%, and then put a down payment on another building at 7%, from what I can tell, I would only be increasing my cashflow by a few % and will have less in accessible equity in 10 years. This seems like it wouldn't be worth it on a risk-adjusted basis.

For example, I'm cash flowing $400/unit right now (bought a low in my market in 2017) and have the equity, and a new turnkey building I think could only get me $100-$200/unit, my current CF would be knocked down to maybe $300-350/unit then the clock on accessible equity is reset.

2037,realestateinvesting,To anyone coming in here to complaint about landlords destroying the world or looking for ways to get rich quick...,"Let me give you a realistic picture of what this business is like for most of us that's not handed a silver spoon. This is not a sob story nor gloating, it's just a snapshot of my personal journey for about the last 15 years. For background I own 10 doors across 6 properties, mix of MFM and SFM that's split 50/50 in LTR and STR. STR I have only gotten in about 2 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents started in real estate investing by buying a small condo. Just one. They never bought another because we ended up putting money into it every month and growing up I remember thinking real estate investing is shit because it doesn't even ""pay"" until 30 years later when it's paid off. It wasn't until when I was older and decided to look into the cash flow did I realize it was not making money because the management company is over charging on management fee, skimming on repairs, and keeping the rent way below market therefore turnover low so they don't have to work. We had a tenant in there that stayed for 10 years with only 2 minor rent increases. Point - This is the biggest mistake my parents made, they thought this business is a hands off get paid for doing nothing business. It's not. You take your eyes off the business and the world will swallow you whole. Passive income my ass.

&amp;#x200B;

This is when my story starts. I came in and fired the management company ,adjusted rent and we were immediately cash positive. Got a new mgmt company and set a new 6% rate, and I personally review all repair quotes and price check before approval to start work. Small repairs I did myself. 

Once realizing RE can be profitable right NOW, I started planning for my first. I made enough at the time from my job to get my own apt and drive a nice car. Instead I shared a trailer home with a roommate and drove a 10 year old beat up truck. Ate pretty much nothing but rice and beans and discounted chicken when grocery stores were closing and they need to toss them. I did side hustles. Didn't go out for a stretch of 6 months straight one time to save money. Point - A lot of you are asking how can you afford down payment in the current environment?!? This is how. Don't spend and save. Personal sacrifices is a big part of EVERYONE's story here.

Got lucky, did not have enough money to buy before the 08 crash, bought a condo in 09 but still mistimed it and not late enough and I was upside down right away. It took me almost 5 years to break back even on that 1st one for value. Point - RE is NOT a guaranteed win, you can lose! And the profit is built on top of risks.

I kept saving and learning, especially about taxes. I spent every morning on the toilet reading about RE tax advantages, investment strategies, and management best practices, this has become a habit for me even to this day. It's through this self-learning that I realized most ""RE gurus"" are show boating morons. All the social media gloat about owning hundreds of doors with millions of income are over leveraged assholes that are only reporting revenue. They are so low on equity that all it takes is one bad recession to wipe them out. Point - Don't listen to any social media gurus, read and learn and form your own strategy that's grounded in fundamentals. RE is not a get rich quick scheme, matter of fact it's actually a get rich very slowly scheme if you do it right (and a little luck doesn't hurt).

Over the years, I continued to save and buy more RE. it wasn't until 5 years ago that I finally rented an apt of my own despite being in the top 10% income in the US. I still rent today but recently upgraded from a studio to a 1 bedroom apt. For 10 years, I drove my beat up truck from my shared apt to my 3 bedroom SFH to meet with my tenants and watched in jealousy with their brand new Mercedes parked in the garage. Every single one of my tenants lived better than me but that only added to my resolve. Point - Not all landlords live on yachts and call their assistant to do everything. Most of us are grinding.

Come construction time, whether a new fixer upper I bought or a capital improvement reno project, it's all hands on deck for my family. Both of my parents help out and I am super grateful for that. Also very grateful that I have a great full time job right now that's remote and allowing me to live on site and still work. Even as I am typing right now, we are in the middle of a reno that's in another state and my whole family is sleeping on air mattresses in the house getting renoed because we want to save the hotel cost. even with a 35% write off, I still don't want to pay the 65% in cost. Why am I onsite for reno? Because it's a hands on business. Contractors make less mistakes and run the job quicker when you are there all the time, every day the house is in reno is one less day I am making money. I also opted to paint myself saving me 3-4k. I also once drove 10 hours to deliver new appliances to a property because the prices by my home is $2k cheaper than the job location. Point - If you are complaining about not being able to buy while there are fixer uppers in your price range that you can put in some sweat equity and own, I don't sympathize with you, sorry.

Every single properties I own I've made capital improvements on and improved the overall neighborhood, ESPECIALLY for the STR properties. I do not suck the blood out of the society in my capitalist ways but instead, I add net value to our society by improving housing conditions and neighborhoods, providing permanent housing to 5 families, and alternative options for people looking for a real home to live in on vacation and not a hotel. Point - If you are mad you can't afford a house. Don't look at private landlords, look at corporations. Everything that's an exceptional value is getting snatched up by Corp with cash and us small time owners are buying the left overs. We are not your enemy.

I am about to buy my first (soon to be) Porsche. My dream car that I couldn't afford until about 10 years ago and CHOSE to not buy for another 10 because it would slow down my growth. Honestly I would've waited for another 10 years if not for the Cayman going to electric in the next couple years. I understand the optics when I show up in a Porsche to tell my tenants rent is going up. ""Why are you raising rent? You don't even need it!"" Yes I fucking do and always will. Point - No one needs anything, you don't need a 3 bedroom house. You don't need a new car. You don't even need anything other than rice, bean and left over chicken to survive. You are only seeing fruits of my hard earned labor for the past 15 years and not the journey on how I got here and certainly not what I will need to do in the future. I do not owe renters any explanation on why I am raising rent. Rent will go up if the market supports it, rent will go down if the market demands it. I answer to the market and not my renters, especially if you have a brand new Mercedes parked in the garage.

I'm looking for some guidance/mentorship.

For context: I just turned 40. Single dad to two kids (16 &amp; 11). Out of a long-term relationship and am almost debt-free, which plagued me all of my 20s and 30s for various reasons - some foolishly and mostly uncontrollably. I have a solid career in a reliable industry, a privately owned company with stock, with a good income. I am very behind on retirement, but I am now maxing the IRS limit and starting to max my rIRA account through a backdoor conversion. 

I am blessed with a living situation where I don't pay rent/mortgage, but I don't own a home.  This might turn into purchasing the home from my elderly grandmother in a couple of years for a good price. 

Question: how are people getting into real estate investing right now with how the economy and interest rates are? Have they saved up capital, or what are the ""secrets"" to getting started? House hacking is enticing, but not with kids. A duplex where I live on one side and rent out the other and then move and rent both sides after a year?

2044,realestateinvesting,Selling a separately deeded garage in a condo complex. Sell or hold / rent.,"I purchased a 10’w x 25’ deep garage in a small condo complex for approximately $11k in 2017. 

It costs me approximately $65 per month in HOA &amp; electrical utility fees. 

I currently rent it out for $225 cash per month to a classic car owner. Rent payed on time every month for 2 years. No problems. 

The crux- when I was going to list it on the open market, the HOA had their lawyer notify me that it could only be sold to an owner of one of the seven condo units as per the Master Deed. I feel this wording is open to interpretation and either way it’s going to cost me money to resolve. I was never a unit owner and I purchased it?!

I value the garage at approximately$200-$230 per square foot =$50k-$57.5k.

Where we are currently at…

A new owner purchased the condo unit &amp; 2 parking spaces next to the garage last year. We have become friendly and he expressed interest in the garage and agreed to discuss in 2023. 

I offered it at $50k
He responded at $30k
I countered with $42.5k
He is holding at $30k and is open to a partial cash deal.

I close on a turn key duplex in Jamestown NY 1bed/2bed next week.
I have flipped 4 houses already by buying beaters, fixing a lot, and selling for a gain. This specific property I bought was part of an estate and I feel I got an incredible deal on it. I got it for $62,000! Rents will be around $600/$750 which calculated out is a crazy GRM.

I’m well aware of how capital gains taxes work on a property you haven’t owned long. I also understand I’d be only walking away with 10k out of a 20-23k increase in property price after the sale (prefer to work with agent and will pay capital gains on gains). My question is basically this. I feel like I could turn around and sell it for 80k right away or maybe wait 6 months so there’s less questions from potential buyers? Do you think this is feasible? Also if I was to relist would I want the property to be rented or vacant as it is now?

2050,realestateinvesting,150k to invest with?,"I'm new to Real Estate investing, and I have been learning as much as I can. Currently, I have 150k cash to invest in, debt-free: no car payment, no mortgage (I live with my mom, help her maintain the house since my Father passed away last year, she does not require me to pay rent), only pay living expenses (food, gas) and car insurance. I make six figures yearly, and I live pretty frugally and save around 60% of my salary after taxes and expenses.

I am currently leaning towards short-term rentals and mid-term rentals (for traveling professionals like travel nurses) as I like the ability to have a higher cash flow (depending on location and other good factors) than long-term rental while at the same time getting appreciation on assets.

I am aiming for 200k to 300k range properties. I live in Houston, so would be targeting suburbs like Sugarland, The Woodlands, Katy, and Pearland along with Houston. 

Would it be smart to just buy 1 property at 20% down 30 year fixed in this Bear market now to see how the cash flow is?

Mortgages at those aforementioned price ranges seem to be around 1600 to 2600 a month (taxes includes) with current interest rates.

I'm looking at comparable STR Airbnbs in the areas with at least 70% occupancy, and it looks like I can cash flow around 500 to 1000 per month per property if everything goes well (big if).

If my first property does well at 500 cash flow average per month, would it be wise to try to ""snowball"" or scale fast and get another 20% down 30-year fix mortage and do the same at another comparable property and cash flow 500 to 1000 like comparable properties? And so on and so on with the capital, debt, and income I have? 

This is all conjecture of course. Potential setbacks like maintenance and repairs and other expenses will have to be factored in. Also, the current recession will shake up things. Should I wait for falling home prices with high-interest rates (Fed hikes due to inflation)? Could always refinance in the future...alot to think about.

I'm just brainstorming. Still trying to learn more before I pull the trigger as I have an opportunity in my 20s, with no debt basically and some capital, to try to get some passive income and asset appreciation. Basically, fear of the future market due to the recession is holding me for now, but also, I feel if I wait too long I might lose out on some deals.

Thank you"

2071,realestateinvesting,Spread last month rent over first 12 months to increase rent in a rent controlled area.,"Works great for the first time landlords, especially if you are in a rent controlled area that doesn't allow increase even if you are hit with tax increase or the tenant moves on. 

To avoid getting sucked in by the rent control,  start by charging higher rent but offer the 12th month free.

For eg if the unit rent is $1k a month or $12k a year,  charge $1090 a month and offer the 12th month free, adding to the same $12k for the year.

If the tax, insurance, etc. increase comes up, just take the bonus month off during renewal, raise $1090 by 4% (say the allowable rent increase), giving you the flexibility to raise the yearly rent to $13,614 ($1090 *1.04* 12) or total 13% increase. If not,  increase the $1090 by 4% and continue to give 12th month free. 

So,

1. You get to increase the rent to adjust for expected upcoming changes.

2. Gives you the flexibility on whether you want to continue the previous arrangement (free last month) and carry it in future while still keeping the option to trigger it. For eg great tenants.

3. Another advantage of this approach is you don't have to take the last month rent from tenant (works for the tenant) but also avoid the situation where tenant requests the last month rent to be adjusted from the security deposit irrespective of what's in the lease. You don't have to ask for SD + 1st month + last months rent as the last piece is not required. 

Just make sure that you aren't offering the first month free but rather the last/12th month free (or 13th month)."

And can we also work out the financing without a mortgage lender? Should I see a real estate lawyer or forget the whole thing?

My uncle and I are close; he’s elderly and single with three adult children but he offered to sell me his rental property first as his children are set up pretty well, and he isn’t super close with them. And I also think he wants to help me out. He’s also told me that he wouldn’t feel right making me pay the current market value. The house is currently occupied by renters and he doesn’t want to deal with it anymore. He still owes a small amount on the mortgage, which I could pay off with my savings in addition to giving him a nice downpayment as well. He told me he’d be happy if I had the house and he had some money to buy an RV and tour North America for several years. I currently rent in a neighboring city and wouldn’t reside in the home, at least for a few years due to work. Everything online makes this type of transaction seem unadvisable, or too costly from tax perspective. But I don’t believe that there aren’t rich families out there that haven’t found ways to help their families out.

Can I finance the house from him and just pay him every month without a mortgage lender? 

How can I purchase his rental without either of us loosing out too badly tax wise?

Another problem is a bad tenant that I would have to deal with. But I've spoken with her and found her another place and we're moving her this weekend.
 
There's a little bit of mold in the house, some roaches. But the foundation is new, the roof is new. I would give %10 down and the rest over 30 years. I'm also going to be given a couple of months to rent the place and see if I still want to buy it after taking a closer look at it.

I realize this is a somewhat non specific question but just curious to get any thoughts from the community. Are you involving your kids in your business in any meaningful way? Have they been interested? How have you been handling it if they aren't?

At the end of the day my son will make his own choice and as long as he's a good person and productive member of society I will be fine with whatever he decides, but it would be nice to think that we may be able to transition this to him someday and that he'd be able to appreciate it."
2118,realestateinvesting,"Should I buy land to build in Hawaii, USA sooner, or wait longer and buy a house?","Hi! TL;DR at the bottom. I posted this in another financial advice subreddit, but I wanted to ask this here because we'd rent out the house considered in this question down the road.

I'm a 31 YO male. Married. No kids. We currently live in Alaska, USA where I'm working as a nurse and  I'm finishing up a job contract 1.5 years from now. We're considering moving back to the island of Hawaii. My wife wants to buy a place there with the long-term goal of taking care of her parents as they age. However, I'm looking at joining the Air Force as a nurse.

We currently have 26k saved for a house and are forested to have at least 60k by the time my job ends in Alaska. If I join the Air Force we're debating whether

1. take the money that we've saved up and buy some land to build on for later. We can always start saving again for another place to actually live in whenever I get out of the military with a 0% down VA loan.

or

1. Keep the downpayment, keep adding to it and then buy a house whenever we'd leave the military and move back to Hawaii. I feel hesitation with the fear of missing out to some extent as we would delay purchasing. The pro would be that we'd have more money saved up for whenever we'd be ready to buy a house.

Another concern is the opportunity cost of not buying some land now for later. The perception would be that we'd have land for later and be closer to building a house in the future. However, to build a house means that we'd have to be living somewhere first, which means that after buying that land, we'd have to start saving for another down payment for a house to live in initially. We could always sell or rent it out down the road.

Also, at what point should we just invest the money compared with leaving it in a high-yield savings account?

TL;DR - Should we buy a plot of land several years down the road before we'd build on it, or should we save the down payment and then buy a house when we're actually ready to build or buy?"

2128,realestateinvesting,Help with first RE investment purchase,"My wife and I found a property we like. We’re going to visit it soon and want to be prepared and look out for the right things. It’s a downtown one bedroom condo in a college city. With a tenant with 5 months left paying $1650. Zillow estimates rental value to be $1800, but if tenant wants to renew we’d keep it at $1650. 



Things we plan on looking at: 


- tenant lease (make sure it’s well written). But what is it like to purchase with a tenant still there? Any legal things we should do? New lease? 


- HOA rules: we want to get a copy of the HOA rules, to make sure the condo is allowed to be rented, policies, etc 


- do an eyeballed inspection of the condo, later we will do a full inspection 


Is there anything we’re missing? With HOA, insurance and 10% as E fund the cost is $660. NOI seems to be $10,200. We wouldn’t use a property manager as we know the city well and live nearby. It would likely appreciate over time and rent will be steady as the college is huge (35k+ students) and renting is cheaper than dorming.


Mortgage/interest would be $880. So even after that we’d cash flow. Initial investment would be about $35k so a ROI of about 30%. Cap rate I calculate as 6%, which is comparable (even a bit higher) to other condos nearby. 


Are condos a bad idea for investments? We were looking at multi families but realistically we don’t have the cash up front to to get one this year."
2129,realestateinvesting,How are you dealing with windstorm insurance for properties in Florida with mortgages during the insurance crisis?,"I manage about $20M of multifamily in Florida with fanniemae debt.  My insurance quote with windstorm came back 5x last year's number; the premium now over $5 per $100 of insurance coverage.  Roofs are new.  There's nothing else to justify the price increase except for the insurance crisis.  I can't shop it around, because a third party agent confirmed the current agent blocked off all markets by submitting incorrect applications in all remaining markets in Florida; they won't accept another application until next year.

That 5x quote is unrealistic, but fanniemae debt holders are contractually bound to insure to fanniemae requirements.  If I don't agree to the squeeze premium of 5x, the loan servicer has the right to force place insurance to their spec at any price they find (which I'm assuming would be the 5x number or potentially better or worse).  

It seems like there are only two realistic options:  Put hazard insurance without windstorm or with windstorm not to fanniemae specifications until the fanniemae servicer finds out, and see whether they react at all, by demanding endorsements, or force placing coverage and react from there.  Or 2, literally pay back the debt with yield maintenance prepayment penalties ranging from 2-10% of the loan amounts, spend the year(s) without windstorm insurance, and refinance (not with fanniemae) when this insurance market squeeze nonsense ends.

Other people in this situation what are you doing?  Debt servicers, how are you reacting to insurance lapses and coverage below requirements during the Florida insurance crisis?  What does the force placed insurance process look like in reality for fanniemae multifamily?  What if insurance premiums are 10x normal functioning market?  100x?

I'm looking for some input on my property situation. I think I'm comfortable with my direction for now, but some constructive criticism/perspective would be welcomed

HHI 180-220k gross. we have 2 rentals:

#1 big city Alberta condo, approx value 210k, 170k on mortgage, mortgage is variable, renews in a years time. mortgage principal $300/mo, we cover $400/mo to float.

#2 big city BC condo, approx value 500k, 420k on mortgage, also variable, renews in 3.5yrs. mortgage principal $700/mo, we cover $400/mo to float.

*for both properties we also cover property tax, water sewer yearly fee, etc (~3000 additional total)

misc:

-clearly both cashflow negative, both purchased at 5% down and lived in, circumstances changed in each instance. NOT ideal I know

-both on variable around 5%. going fixed 1 yr ago on both mortgages would have saved us a lot of dough. still easily affordable to float both on our incomes. 

-somehow we managed to get amazing tenants in both rentals that want to stay.

- both units have 'appreciated' ~15% this past year based on assessment, or about $100k. I know this is artificial,  see below for notes on property.

i know having income tied up floating rentals isn't ideal. but the potential for significant value appreciation long-term is what makes me want to ride it out.

the cases for property appreciation despite overall poor market conditions:

#1: migration to Alberta forecasted to bolster price retention over the near-medium term.

#2: neighbourhood being gentrified, &gt;5 high rise towers currently under construction, massive developments planned.

can anyone paint me a picture where it's worth it to go through the hassle of selling one, or both, just so that a small part of our income (&lt;10%) isn't floating these properties? or is holding them the best course? we are now saving around 24k/yr on average.

I'm sure I've left out pertinent details, happy to add for constructive thinkers."
2132,realestateinvesting,Are you not allowed to advertise a property that is coming soon to market?,I have a contract with a realtor to list my house. I am waiting on a couple of repairs that should take about 2 weeks but in the meantime I have made some nice ads with photos of the property that I have been posting on town pages and what not in social media advertising that the property is coming soon to market. A whole lot of people had reached out after seeing the ads and I had directed all of them to the listing agent that I am under listing agreement with. Apparently a day later somebody called MLS and complained about a coming soon property being advertised and realtor asked me to take the ads down for now. What violation did we actually do here? Both my realtor and his broker initially said this was fine to do.
2133,realestateinvesting,"As an appraiser, for the sales comparison valuation or CMA, how do you specifically adjust residential comps in reports based on different square-footage, number of bedrooms, amenities, etc?","What numbers do you use?

For the youtube video, ""Chapter 17 Part 1 Intro to Valuation, Intro To Sales Comparison Approach"" starting at 53 minutes in, a professor explains adjusting comparables.

For an [example](https://i.imgur.com/pfre8tV.png), a subject property has 3 bedrooms; the comp has 2 bedrooms. ""Full bathrooms in the area are valued at $8000 each."" **How is that value come up with?** What specific values do you use to adjust comps?

For square-footage differences, is it just based off what the comp sold for per sq-ft? For instance, if a comp sold for $100/sq-ft, and has 500 more sq-ft, the comp's sold price is subtracted by $50k (100x500). Or is that method incorrect? The professor in the video just uses ""for the area"" again in a different [example](https://i.imgur.com/mVNa52M.png).

I can very comfortable afford a 15 year fixed loan around ~5%. The 15 year fixed would be around $6,700 per year. 
The 30 year loan at ~6% would 21% less expensive than the 15 year loan. And it would be around $5,300 per year. 

Here my question. I only want to stay for 4ish years and then upgrade to a different size home. And I want to rent out this home. 
I looked at what similar houses are renting for right now and a house like this would rent for $4kish today. 

Is it foolish to be buying a home now when I only want to stay there for 4 years and then rent it? 
Do you think the rental market would come up so I would at least cover my mortgage in 4 years? Will I be able to refinance after 4 years to get a lower rate, to reduce my mortgage? If I do this, would it be better to get a 15 yr loan or a 30 yr loan now, if I plan to refinance in 4 years?

2153,realestateinvesting,Condo: sell or rent?,"We just bought a new house and are moving out of the 2 br condo we currently own. Not sure if we should sell the condo, or keep it and rent it out.

Based on my preliminary research:
- this condo will rent for $2200 - $2500 / month
- monthly costs are $2500 all in (incl. property tax)
- condo is 3 years old so I don't expect an increase in maintenance cost anytime soon 
- I expect interest rates to hold steady and go down in the coming years (lower cost) 
- I expect housing prices to go up as interest rate goes down (appreciation)  

Typically, I would not invest in a cash-flow negative or breakeven rental and speculate on the market, however, since this was my primary home, I'm already invested lol.

Our dual-job monthly income can cover both monthly costs at the new house and the condo, but the thought of doing that makes me uncomfortable, especially given the possibility of recession and one of us losing our jobs. 

The equity in the condo, if sold, can be used in a number of other profitable investments in my opinion: being a private lender, buying another cash-flow positive rental

How should I be looking at renting the condo as an investment:
1. Am I keeping a bad investment and speculating on appreciation?
2. Or am I just keeping my property and any rental income is a bonus? 
3. Or is this a good investment and I'm missing something?

Appreciate any advice!"
2154,realestateinvesting,Convincing to seller finance and other negotiation tips,"So I am looking at numerous multi family properties in St Louis MO.

My criteria is that it should be in C area, at least, and yield 10% CoC or more and have cap rate of 8%+.

Well, naturally buying at 5.5-6% cap rate could have been a reasonable idea 1 year ago, but now that would cash flow negative.

So I am making numerous offers of the following kind. 

Say it’s listed at 250K and NOI is $15,000. 6% cap. I need to get to 8% cap to meet my criteria since buying at asking is negative cash flow.

So I need to get to $187,500. I buy w/o agent so I tell them asking price is $242,500 since they are saving 3% in fees. 

Well $55,000 is obviously a huge discount but otherwise numbers don’t work. So I make two offers:

1) $187,500 cash, quick closing;
2) full asking of $242,500. Seller finance at 3% for 10 years, 20% down. My numbers work then. 

So far I had a lot of close calls (they’d counter at $205,000 cash and I would pass cause my criteria are not met).

How to be more convincing about seller financing? I understand people who bought 2 years ago won’t do it since they have a mortgage, but many own paid off properties. 

I understand proposed terms are bad, but otherwise properties are overpriced. 

Any tips? I am happy to make 100 offers and buy 1 great property rather than buy a terrible deal. 

I also offered a subject to sale, or to assume their mortgage if it’s VA or FHA."

1) I don't make a lot of money, so I'd have to borrow against the property, I suppose. It seems like a risk and the current guaranteed income isn't too shabby.

2174,realestateinvesting,Let me explain to you why buying more cash flowing rentals helps your DTI and doesn't hurt it,"Ok so this is something that I was always so confused about because no one explained it. I thought that if I had a W2 income I would be stuck after buying a few rentals because my DTI would get too high. Let me explain to you why this isn't the case. 

**What I initially thought**

Let's assume I have a W2 annual income of $100k. Let's also I assume I have a $5k annual car loan (debt). Lastly let's assume I have a property that generates $100k of annual income and has $50k in annual mortgage debt. 

My annual income is: $100k W2 + $100k rental = $200k  
My annual debt is: $5k car loan + 50k mortgage = $55k

That would me that my Debt To Income **RATIO** would be $55k/$200k = $27.5%, right? **WRONG!**

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's how it actually works**

Debt To Income Ratio is a very misleading title because it's not actually your full debt divided by your full income, there are some specific rules when it comes to real estate. 

The way it works is that you calculate your real estate finances first, and then either apply that to ONLY debt or ONLY income. Let me explain. 

Let's say I still have that W2 annual income of $100k, $5k annual car loan, and a $100k income property with $50k of PITIA debt on it. In order to calculate my DTI I need to first find if my property counts as debt or income. 

The rule is you take 75% of your rental income and then subtract the debt. Using my property I get ($100k \* 0.75) - $50k = +$25k. This means that I can count my property as an income of $25k with no debt. This means my finances would be:

* My annual income is: $100k W2 + $25k rental = $125k
* My annual debt is: $5k car loan 

This means my DTI is $5k/$125K =  4%. Yay low DTI so I can buy more properties! 

  
Now let's switch this up, let's assume that my property only produces $50k of income on with $50k of PITIA debt. Using my property I get ($50k \* 0.75) - $50k = -$12.5k of debt for my real estate. My updated finances would be: 

* My annual income is: $100k W2
* My annual debt is: $5k car loan + $12.5k real estate debt = $17.5k

This means my DTI is $17.5k/$100 =  17.5%. DTI is higher so that's why you gotta buy cash flowing properties. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Why did I spend 25 minutes writing this up? Because this confused the f\*ck out of me and I didn't know how this worked so long. I hope this can help free up confusion for new investors to understand how someone with a $100k W2 can build a portfolio of 20 properties."

2185,realestateinvesting,"1031 exchange, worth it?","We were not considering an 1031 exchange but our repairs on our rental property are taking longer and now we know where we are moving earlier than expected. 

We have rented our primary residence for 10 yrs, now making some minor repairs since the tenants moved out then going on the market. A conservative estimate of profit is $100k. We were going to eat the taxes on it due to timelines. Well now we know our next base (military) and looking at the market we could do a 1031 exchange for another rental property but most would require a rehab. (Which affects the 180 day timeline) There are like 4 or 5 we are interested in. 

We have enough cash to buy a primary residence without need for the profit from our rental property. So is it worth it? Or is it for someone who does rentals as a full-time job since Im doing it more passively? Am I being unrealistic? Im curious if Im in over my head considering it."

2189,realestateinvesting,"Having trouble deciding wether or not to sell, is there a formula to use?","Hi all, I am in indecisive hell right now.  
I bought a commercial/residential property about 4 years ago in a tourist city (Louisville, KY) in a hot area, and have been living and working in/on it this entire time.  
I have done so much work, removing a wall, gutting and re-doing a bathroom, painting everything, newly refinished original floors, skylights to open it up, new conrete patio, I even dug up and repaired the sewer line (myself, with a hand shovel, 6 feet down) because of tree root intrusion. It's been a labor of love but I'm burned out. Now that the house is finished, and I am now in a different primary home, I am trying to decide wether to just sell and cash out, or AirBnb it for the bourbon tourism industry and Derby. I estimate an average income of 3600/month (300/night, 3 night minimum, sleeps 6, plus triple rate for Derby to offset the off-season). If I sell, I could walk away with $200k

The problem is, I don't really see myself in this city for even the next 12 months, but if I make it a solid STR with good ratings, then I feel confident that I have enough contacts in the area to keep it going.

I know that not everyone always holds properties, a lot of people sell, how do you make that decision is what I'm trying to figure out. I go back and forth nearly daily, some days I just want to cash out while everything is nice and newly renovated/painted, and then other days, people tell me ""Don't sell, that place is a goldmine!), and I change my mind. It is really causing me a lot of anxiety, and costing me $$ having it sit there waiting to make a final decision.

2209,realestateinvesting,Does this investment opportunity sound legit or a scam,"&amp;#x200B;

I’m a novice so please bear with me.   
My question is—is this a good investment or shady?

We  live in FL. A realtor we know works for a building company that builds these “SIP” panels that are basically pre-manufactured eco friendly walls that allow for quick construction. The deal is we front 200k (cost to  build a house) and 15-20k (cost of the lot). So we would own both. The realtor is an employee of this construction company. His building company builds a house in about 6 months and is cash positive. We  have used him to buy houses to live in, and asked him about investment properties before he joined this company which is how we got involved. 

After the company builds and sells the house, we get the investment back plus 50 percent of profit (so roughly if they sell for 320, we would get 50-60k profit). They are, also, promising to pay the  interest on this loan supposedly about 6%. Since we would sell in less than 2 years and would not be a primary residence, I’m not sure how the capital gain would play out unless we roll into 1031. So, we are basically loaning them 220k and they are organizing the construction, subcontractors, permits. They, also, intend to pass some of the tax write off from construction expenses.

 Does this seem fair/legit? Any red flags? This is the rough idea, don’t have the contract or exact numbers yet. The ROI would be roughly 20-22 percent."

If you don't already, you need to set up a separate email for all your real estate investment stuff.

Gmail is awesome, it's an all in one CRM basically (Even though I use zoho... or am learning to properly use one lol) Now you can even download a note add on the sticks to the top of each different thread, and you can see a highlight of it from the main inbox screen.

When negotiating deals, you're going to probably piss some people off and/or just get ignored by some people. It's going to happen - don't lose your cool though lol.

I make sure I'm always the last to reply, and I delay my response depending where we are in negotiations. The closer we are to a deal, the quicker I respond etc.

So like I said, eventually I'll get ghosted. With my Gmail, I go to the back page where the oldest emails are.

From here I'll go and reply to anything that I haven't received a response from in ~30 days. I just send a simple - Hey has this sold? or Is this still available?

And you know what, I still get ignored a bunch. But I get some people that will reply back and now I know they're having a hard time offloading the deal.

Then every 30ish days later I'll go to the back of the inbox again and ask the same! Some times the last email I sent was has this sold? To which I'll word it differently. If I don't get a reply after the third email, I won't bother them anymore. If they also tell me to stop emailing them, I won't reply back - you can get in real trouble for this if you keep ""spamming' them.

1. I now invest in only B class or better neighborhoods hoping to get tenants who are more likely to take care of your place 

2. Look for tenants with 650+ credit score because I know they have skin in the game to more likely pay rent.

3. Invest in a landlord friendly state in case tenants stop paying rent even after trying to work with them. Easier to evict

4. Making sure tenants are happy is important to me, in return they take care of the place,  pay rent and less likely to have tenant turnover.

5. I don’t just look at cash-flow as measure of success. I zoom out and look at the bigger picture. Cash-flow can be eaten up by a bad tenant. 

Anyway still not an expert and will always learn from others. Excited to see what you have learned from investing! Thanks for sharing."

2. Save up, say 30K??, to be competitive in the US housing market.
3. After being pre-approved, go through the steps to purchase a duplex. 
4. Have my tenants pay for my rent until I break even.
5. Build up the cash flow surplus for another down payment. 
6. Quit my W2 job, live off of passive income from two or more houses, and work full time as a performing artist.

2271,realestateinvesting,How Much Is In Your Rental Emergency Fund?,"I have a couple of duplexes, and have decided to get a little more risk off in terms of expansion and am going to focus on saving and standard retirement investing through etfs, but before I do that I want to sure up my emergency fund. 

When I had my single duplex and was house-hacking I had modest expenses and my emergency fund was at $5000. I believe that was too little at the time but was renovating the unit so all dollars were going there. I wanted to continue growth so I bought a second and renovated that, and the emergency fund remained the same. 

Now that I am becoming a little more conservative financially I am struggling to come up with a number. Should I cover 6 months of expenses for both houses plus person expenses? Somewhere in the area of $40k. Or do I assume rent will be paid most of the time and keep a random amount of say $20,000 for expenses that would end up being a big bill? 

In Ontario eviction for non payment seems like it’s about a year wait, so it can be a big risk to get a tenant who doesn’t pay, but clearly I wouldn’t be in a situation where all 3 tenants aren’t paying.

2295,realestateinvesting,Multifamily Partnership... Deadend?,"A year ago this month, I purchased a multifamily property with my cousin. The experience has been mostly great, but I'm trying to figure out the next steps to expand and continue growing investments. At this point, I feel like I'm doing it all myself, with a live-in tenant.

Background: The property purchase was originally my idea as I have some background with real estate and my license. We intended to rent, but the economics and opportunity made far more sense to buy and it is a growing market despite issues with the broader market. I fully expected to do more of the documentation and bookkeeping as this is my strength, but it's really turned into nothing gets done unless I do it, including maintenance, lawn care, etc. I realize this is probably just differences in personality and we're better off not living together/ being business partners, but I'm fine with staying mostly quite about things since I don't want to upset the friendship dynamic.

Ultimately, when we move out (1 year or so), the property will have to be leveraged or sold if I wish to continue growing. (This stays true even if we hold and rent it). Ultimately, the experience has been good, but I do not wish to continue a partnership where I do all the work for half the benefit. I'm looking for the best medium-term strategy to walk away and do it myself. (28 and have student loans to pay off before having the cash flow to purchase by myself).

2299,realestateinvesting,Debating selling cash flow positive Townhouse for Beach Rental,"Hi Everyone, 

I've really enjoyed reading all the advice and situations people have on here and am looking forward to your thoughts on my current decision point of keeping a current rental I have or selling for a beach rental which my family consistently uses every year. Sorry for the long post, I just want to be thorough in providing information upfront. 

My wife and I have a single rental (the home I purchased prior to meeting her and decided to rent out after we moved in together). It is a 3br/2.5ba townhome. Original mortgage 152k 30 year at 5% originating in late 2010, current value based on comps 265k. Remaining principle 80k. Currently rented for $1450. I use a PM service which charges 11%. Monthly HOA is a killer, at $130 but includes pool, roof insurance, exterior lawn/tree/greenery care, paint, etc.  I put $50 extra towards mortgage principle every month. Yearly maintenance reserve is $200 (roof, water heater, HVAC area all replaced in ca. 2018) resulting in cash flow positive is about $130 a month. Tenant has been in 3 out of the 3 years I have rented it and other than a few issues, relatively painless and always pays on time. Lease is due for renewal April 1 2023. Rent will increase by $50 if I decide to offer a renewal. Overall it is a very good, safe, and simple situation (or so I believe.....I've never had a rental before, but this particular one is very little headache or work for me). I don't have any desire to switch to being a landlord as my full time primary income - I just kind of fell into this situation and it seems to be working out well that the tenant is paying off my mortgage. This property has zero role in my retirement portfolio and I only consider it as a bonus/nice to have whenever the time comes to sell it or it gets paid off.

Now for the decision point.

My family (about 10 of us) go to the beach (east coast Carolinas) for vacation every year. Every single year in about the same week, like clockwork for 15+ years and I don't see this changing anytime soon. The beachfront houses we rent are in the 6-9k/week range. It's been a dream of mine to own one of these rental beach houses, have it for rent the other 51 weeks of the year and my family stay in it during that week ""free of charge"" (for them at least - my wife and I wouldn't charge anyone of course. It would just be lost rental income).

If we were to sell the townhouse rental at 265k, combine it with liquid savings of various sorts, we have about 280k cash to be used for down payment/home updates/whatever (which is growing each month as we continue to save toward this goal). The houses we are looking at are between 1.2-1.5m. I've researched about rental secured mortgages as opposed to income secured and I understand we could get approved for this loan with 20% down with a proven rental history. (if it matters, our combined income is 250k/yr engineer and nurse practitioner by trade, 1 vehicle loan with 30k remaining, 1 primary residence home loan with ca. 170k remaining - no other debt). I'm having trouble finding information though on cash flows of beach rentals though. Especially when I don't want to winter over in the home like several of the home owners do and the online info suggests. It will be a rental 51/52 weeks of the year. A key point here is that the beach home needs to be cash flow positive if that wasn't obvious already. My immediate family is in the construction business and during un-rented weeks, time in the beach home is a potential bartering chip for maintenance/construction labor, but I don't consider this as a massive savings nor does it play a key role in this decision. I am located ca. 4hrs by car from the properties.

My question is am I absolutely crazy to throw away a perfectly good cash flow positive rental, which is knocking about 7k off my mortgage principle/year (albeit with high HOA and a PM) for a beach rental (which will have more issues, maintenance, tenant problems, higher PM, new loan, etc. etc.) in the current market to pursue this dream? Or are beach rentals an absolute nightmare to deal with and I'm better off in my current situation and spending the 6-9k/year renting for our family vacation. Or are they killer income sources when you're not going to be wintering over in the beach home?

Thanks everyone for any advice you can give!"
2300,realestateinvesting,What would you do in this situation?,"Just wondering how some of you would approach this…

Basically, I have 2 rental properties with positive cash flow of about $1,300/mo total. I bought each place in 2019, and 2020 before the lockdowns.

I’m planning on moving out of state in a few months, and wondering if I should keep or sell them considering that that if I sell them both I’d walk away with $140k — that’s being conservative.

I know this answer varies for everyone, but isn’t the reason we invest to earn rental income while the property value increases, and then sell? I didn’t expect to see this type of return for like 5-8 years… but here I am.

2 Units, owner occupied.

$4800 month all in mortgage payment.

Rented unit - 2 bed 1 bath - $2300/month

Occupied unit - 3 bed 2 bath - market value - $2800-$3000 a month when compared to neighboring units.

Previously we were living in a shoe box apartment for much less and are very much enjoying the newfound space, but obviously at the cost of a much heftier monthly payment. 

I’m trying to determine if it would be wiser to fully rent out the house to cash flow and rent in the short time(come April), allowing for saving more money for next down payment.

2314,realestateinvesting,Spreadsheet to compare keeping house as rental vs investing in the stock market/ETF?,"Hi all,

We're considering purchasing a house and keeping our existing house as a rental, however I'd like to compare some scenarios such as:

1) Sell original house, buy new house.

2) Keep original house as rental, buy new house. Finance xx%. Keep as much money in the stock market as possible.

3) Keep original house as rental, buy new house with as much cash as possible. Replenish portfolio with rental income and job.

4) Keep original house as rental, do something in between #2 &amp; #3.

Is there any kind of Excel/Google sheet to make these comparisons? I'm working on one but I'm not the best at it!

Thanks!"

2316,realestateinvesting,Trusts and LLC’s for rental properties?,"I’m looking to purchase my first rental duplex this year from a family friend. It’s a great deal, needs some repairs, but will cash out refinance to utilize the equity I’ll have in it. I plan on using the cash from the refinance as down payment on another duplex or 2 townhomes, then go from there in the years to come building a portfolio (mostly BRRR method).

Before beginning this new venture, I was wondering if it was smart to create a trust for the future real estate rental portfolio? Also, should I then have the trust “own” LLC’s and create LLC’s for each rental property I acquire? If not, should I create an LLC for all properties as a whole under the trust? I’ve heard this trust and LLC strategy is good for liability shielding and tax reasons.

I’m a NJ resident and all properties will be in NJ. I’m assuming to create the trust in NJ but the LLC(s) in a more business friendly state like DE?

Any tips, knowledge, experience on trusts/LLC’s for real estate investments would be much appreciated. Thank you so much!"

2318,realestateinvesting,Does it make sense for me to buy right now given my numbers?,"So my situation is a bit unique. I'm in Phoenix and making $100k + 12% bonus a year (potentially $112k or even more with my performance) and I have 0 debt. My parents gifted me their current house awhile back as they are in their late 80's. Their house (paid off) can be rented out at a MINIMUM of $2k (probably closer to 2.5k+ for the area and sqft (2.5k)). The new build I want is $670k + $15k corner lot premium (there's no one behind us and no one to our left). It's the ideal house, builder, and location I want. They are covering the closing cost upwards of 20k. The house is from Lennar and it has a NEXT GEN suite (separated guest home attached to the main home). I can rent this out for a minimum of $1k.

However, given unprecedented times, the interest rate is 7% which give or take $4.3k for my mortgage, home insurance, property tax, HOA, etc. before my utilities/electricity.

High leve:, I bring in give or take $6k net income after my 401k/health insurance/taxes.

New home: 4.5k

Rent old home: $2k

Rent NEXT gen suite: 1k

Potentially = $1.5k + utilities 

Liquid Savings: $160k, I plan to put down 20% which is around $135k leaving me $25k for rainy day savings + my 401k, Crypto, etc. 

I'm not in a rush to buy but given my dad's detoriating health, I want my parents to enjoy a brand new home before they eventually pass (mom late 70's, dad late 80's), they will move in with me as I take care of them. It's my goal to give them a better quality of life and our current home is nearly 30 years old.

Does my math make sense or am I stretching my budget?"

We would like to convert this to a rental and buy a new house in a slightly better neighborhood for our primary residence at some point this year (when rates subside). We have approximately $50K in cash saved. 

If our budget for our primary is $225K, 20% down would be $45K. Would it be better to instead put only 5% down on a new primary at $11,250 and pay PMI? That would leave us around $38K in hand to have as a basis for a down payment on any investment properties that may pop up. The other option is to go all in on the $45K and start saving again from nothing. 

On one hand, I'm afraid we'll be throwing money away every month by paying PMI if we only put down %5. On the other hand, I'm afraid we will miss out on some potential investment properties if we wipe out our reserve and put down the $45K."
2327,realestateinvesting,To sell rental prop or not,"Looking for opinions. 
Own 4 rental props all paid off. 
Self manage but recently moved out of area. 

3 have maintenance on site and are upscale properties with professional tenants I can leave be. 

The 4th is garden style. Had stable but low income tenant for 10 years. Haven't raised rent on her. I'm too nice but I like a stable tenant. Money isn't every thing, I net 700/month on this property. . 

So issue is I get noise complaints on her and her kids all the time from hoa. 

Also hoa has gone up from 300 to 550/month 
So after all expenses incl prop tax I only net 700/month.

I can sell for 485k. Net 385k after cap gains, agent commissions. Paid 153k in 2009.

That means I can pull twice as much cash from that net profit each month while it earns 4% in bank for 16 plus years. Twice as much net income as current rent plus no maintenance, no hoa, no noise complaints, no visits as I'm out of area and need to pay someone if I need to take care of something. 

Is this a no brainer? 

I'm hesitant to let go of any property but this may make sense to let it go. 

If I get new tenant I can raise rent to market and make 1200/month but but why bother? 

Mostly cause I'm 52 and planning retirement.

A tract home builder near us is offering 4.75% interest rates for the life of the loan if you buy from them. I know they aren’t the most amazing quality in the world and they’re far from our dream home, but my plan is to one day own 10+ properties so you have to start somewhere. 

We went under contract this past Friday for a purchase price of $289,900 for a 5 bed, 3 bath, 2,500 SF property with an estimated mortgage of $1,750 a month, taxes and insurance escrow included in that estimate (no PMI due to VA loan). 

Rents in my area are $1800-$2200 for our current primary home. 

We’d be cash flowing $700+ a month on our current home. 

We are obviously going to self manage and put all of the cash flow into an account for repairs, but luckily the home is only 4 years old.

The cons: it's 20 minutes from a train (so an Uber costs 30+ bucks for those without a car), it's 1.5 baths, only 1500 sf,  it has high taxes (around 14K for a property selling for 500K), an old house from the 20's.    No shopping within 15+ minutes drive.

The risks:  local town decides to ban STRs (there are practically no neighbors though);    flooding (can hear babbling brook from home in yard but structure is not on flood map).

2339,realestateinvesting,Best option to get into real estate,"My wife and I (25) got pre approved for either a $450k mortgage for a rental or we can sell/rent our current house which brings it up to $780k. 


- option 1: rent our house: I asked on here a week ago about renting my current house and got some help with the math, it seems like the NOI would be $28k and it would have some cash flow. Which isn’t as important to us as we just like the house and have a 2.4% interest, so we think long term it would be beneficial to keep it and rent as long as we aren’t losing much. It also is likely to appreciate decently in the area. Buy a $450k house for ourselves. 


- option 2: buy a $450k multi family in nearby college down. The nicer houses are closer to $550k, but even the one we can afford would cash flow decently as the college dorms drive up the rent. College charges $13k/yr for a triple, so rent kind of matches that per tenant. The problem here is always renting to college students who (from experience there) kind of trash the houses. But good side is always renters and the college helps keep rent high with their crazy dorm costs. I’ve also ran the numbers on a few houses and NOI and ROI checks out.


- option 3: kind of tagging off option one, rent out our current house and get ourselves a $700k ish house closer to the main city, we both work remote but likely will have to return to office. With traffic we’re 90-120min outside the city. Only 35min without traffic. But we don’t like the commute so we like this option to get closer. The problem is I’d like advice on how to get a renters agreement before hand to be able to purchase the house. Do we make a contingency on us closing? Do we just put X move in date and hope we have a house by then? Maybe it’s possible to use HELOC to qualify for a higher mortgage? We have about $80k in equity on the house and $65k in cash. (Will get another $30k by June)


- option 4: we just aren’t ready to dive in yet and should save more/invest

Currently I pay rent $500. The way it works in my country is that the government pays a lot for living expenses when you don't have much income so I get about $330.


There are some nice new apartment buildings in the downtown of the city I study in. The apartments are small and are in a great location. More young people are moving to this city every year so I assume this kind of an apartment will be in high demand in the future.


I could buy one of those apartments for 30k (I have around 55k in savings) and I would get a 70k debt share. This means every month I'd be paying $350 debt + $150 of other expenses (= $500). So in total the same that I pay for rent right now. 


The way I think about this is that I could move to this apartment, and still get the $330 from government (because the debt also counts as a living expense). So my living expenses wouldn't change at all but now instead of a 30k on my back account I'd have an apartment that is increasing in value $350 a month as I pay off the debt?


This kind of seems to good to be true which is why I'm wondering if there's something that I'm missing in my calculation. This is my first time making a big investment so I'm kind of stressed that I'll do something wrong haha. Any thoughts would be really appreciated!"

We just opened a business bank account in 2022 and have been putting $300 in the account from our W2 every two weeks to build funds, but we definitely don't have enough to buy a house in cash. We are thinking we need to sell our house to the LLC for $1. 

The house is worth about $60k. We could rent it traditionally for about $1,000/month or $1,600/month short-term AirBnB rentals. The house needs some renovations, but it is completely livable. It needs a new roof (old roof shingles), bathroom renovation, air conditioning, waterproofing in the basement, etc. We are thinking that we could transfer the property to our LLC and get some kind of property loan or refinance loan through the company to fix it up and rent it out, creating a cash flowing asset.

Honestly, I have no idea what is the best route to take. Most information online about real estate investing is about buying properties that will have a mortgage or getting investment funds from someone. Our families are poor and we are the only ones who can invest in us.

This is pretty complicated and a lot to read, but I figured someone might be interested in chiming in.

# Quick summary of my idea

Summer of 2020, I bought a house in the suburbs of houston for roughly $275k. 30 year loan, 0.125% interest rate conventional loan. My house has now appreciated to the $340-$440k range (I know this is a wide gap, not important at the moment). No PMI, I have like $250k left on the balance of the loan. The loan may also be assumable. **Could I sell the house way above market rate, but allow the buyer to assume my loan and they can take a loan for the rest of the balance?**

$245k @ 0.125 % interest saves the buyer $930\~ a month for 27 more years left on the loan is **$300k in interest savings over todays 7% rate. Is this concept even remotely possible?**

&amp;#x200B;

# Where it gets tricky

&amp;#x200B;

* The only way I know anything about the loan being assumable is that on my closing disclosure, it says ""if you sell or transfer this property to another person, your lender -
   * **(this box is checked)** Will allow, under certain conditions, this person to assume this loan on the original terms 
   * **(not checked)** Will not allow assumption of this loan on the original terms""

&amp;#x200B;

* The loan is through NACA, but Bank of America underwrote and services the loan. It is conventional 30 year with no PMI. This is not a USDA or VA loan, once again its conventional. 
   * Would the NACA rules/criteria follow the loan if the loan was assumed?
      * NACA has some whacky rules, main ones being I could not own other property on closing date of this one (afterwards, you can own as much as you want).
      * And, NACA loans force you to owner occupy for the entire duration of the loan, or refinance if you move out.
      * NACA has a $25k lien against the property through them to enforce these rules, but if the math makes sense and there's no other real way around it, the lien could just be paid off correct?
      * I cannot find ANY information on NACA's website/forums about their program loans being assumable or not, only that some certain business loan they offer is NOT assumable.

  


**If I could work through all of these issues and this idea is even remotely possibly, what's a rough guess of how much over market value I could get for the house + assumed mortgage?**

All the single family, townhouses, 2-4 multi-family, and 4+ multi-family with a 7% to 9% interest DSCR loan; you have to put down 50% to 66% to get a positive cash flow at asking price.  Even then the positive cash flow is 1% to 2% cash on cash return.  I would be better putting the cash in no penalty CD at 3.75% for holding and can pull it out at anytime.

Even if I ignore asking price; it would require a price drop of 33% at minimum if not lower, plus still require a larger down payment.

In all scenarios, I have not even accounted for cash, if needed, for rehab or general prep, clean, ect...  I am running very very tight numbers and more then likely too tight numbers to just see how close I am to making the numbers work.

I know you can accelerate depreciation and other tax strategies and then factor in equity appreciation, but still these numbers are so far off that even then its not doable.

I have looked at 10 year interest only loans, they make the numbers better, but they still require a price drop and a large down payment.

Are others putting down huge amounts of money to be cash flow positive?  If so are you hoping rates drop to refi?  Just ""live"" on the low cash on cash return for now and in 5-7 years, refi and get some of the equity out?  Are you submitting doable low price offers to sellers as a whatever lets just see if they take it?"

As I mentioned, it is the only piece of land I might be able to buy cash at this time. The land is vacant, and in the r-3 zone. The land is surrounded by homes valued at 5x the price of the land. I talked to a real estate agent who will put me in contact woith some local developers to get the price to get a home built on the property. 

There are a couple other lots of land in the immediate area. The lot I am considering is a little over twice the size of vacant lots next to it. 

I know that owning land is important. And this is why I am doing it. But, I really think I can make a profit by splitting the land in half, selling one half, and building a multi family home on the other.

2403,realestateinvesting,Questions/reality check,"Reality check?

Hi everyone, long time lurker. New account because relatives are aware of my main account and I’d rather play this a little closer to the chest. 

I’m pretty young, just starting out my career, currently renting, and have been researching RI over the past year. I have about $20k I would feel comfortable using to invest. I have additional funds but I intend those for future education or emergencies and am not willing to dip into them. 

My lease ends in July, and I’ve been wondering if now is the right time to begin house hacking. Since it’s a few months out, I would be able to add maybe $5k+ in additional savings to that previous $20k already saved. I save about $1.5k a month and can put most of that toward the house. I’m in an area where there are a few (not many but enough to have options!) decent 3 bedroom homes around for about $250k. I’ve been pre approved for $270k at 5% down and around 5.5% interest, but I’m still shopping around for good loan options. I also haven’t committed to a realtor yet or anything. 

My general thought is that I would purchase a ready in live in 3 br, live in one bedroom and rent out the other two. From my understanding, the monthly payment on the house would be $1900-1800 (maybe as low as $1500?), and I could rent each room for about $900-800, which theoretically allows me rent free living. This would allow me to save a lot more each month than I do now, but would probably wipe out that 20k completely. And I’m not sure how 0 rent compares to the costs of house maintenance.

A few questions: 

* Does that plan seem reasonable? I know I could make the purchase with the savings I have, I’m just not sure if it’s a good idea. It’s a little hard to conceptualize cost and cash flow as a beginner. I’ve heard that 10% of cash flow should go toward maintenance, and while I wouldn’t have much of a cash flow, I could easily put 10% of the monthly expenses toward repairs if I’m living for free. 

* Should I be considering condos as a house hacking option as well? There are also cheaper condos I’ve looked at, but they tend to have only 2 br (meaning less rental options, if the HOA even allows renting), and HOA fees run the monthly payment as high as the monthly payment for a more expensive house. However, I know condos tend to have much lower maintenance, so I’m still looking at them. 

* How often are there repairs needed that inspection doesn’t catch? This might be a big pitfall for me. I intend to only consider homes with minimal repair costs, as I don’t have the funds or skills to drop $10k etc on an unexpected repair right after buying. After a few months though, I will be able to rebuild funds for repairs, but the first few months might be difficult. I’m aware of the general timeline for replacing/repairing HVAC, the roof, etc., mostly just concerned about the unexpected.

* How much can be made for renting a house as a unit, vs renting out specific bedrooms? I plan on living in whatever I purchase for 1-4 years, but probably not much longer. From my research, it looks like a 3 br house would go for $2000-1900 a month rented as a whole, which would only put me at breaking even. That doesn’t seem like enough to justify the purchase. That fact alone makes me thing that now is not the right time for me to make this type of purchase. I do plan to make improvements to the home during my time there, but I don’t want to count on that as a requirement.

* Would you suggest a mortgage broker for a beginner? So far I’ve found some decent rates just shopping around, so curious if the additional fees are worth it to most. 

If anyone has any insight I would much appreciate it! The idea of getting out of the rental game and starting investing in real estate appeals to me, but I’m still very much new to it and would love to hear from those with more understanding and experience. 

Thanks! :)"

2419,realestateinvesting,Help analyze a big deal/talk me out of it,"I am currently looking at a wholesale contract assignment (more on that later). 4 buildings, 16 units, fully rented.

The current price is $1.3M. The assignor originally wanted $1.6M and went down quite a lot. He wrote me an offer at $1.4M 2 weeks ago, where it was seen that he got it under contract for $1.3M and needed to assign fast.

About the deal. 

16 units, 16 1-bedroom, 2 2-bedroom.

Current rents $14,625 a month - 5% vacancy = $166,725 a year in revenue.

Property tax 1.05% ($13,650), insurance 0.5% (6,500). They recently renovated the units, but I model 10% of gross rents for maintenance. Trash $1000, water and lawn care $4,800 a year. 

NOI $123,265 a year, cap rate 9.21%. 

In my understanding, most comps are at 7.8-8.2% cap rate. And 9.21% cap rate on a multi family in a safe area seems good anyway. 

Now, financing. This is the tricky part. 

At 7.5% interest with 20% down  debt service is $89,880 a year, leaving me with clear $33,385 a year or CoC of 12.47%. 

I can do better by financing 1 of the 4 properties with FHA loan 3.5% down and 6.5% interest (and PMI). 

In that case, I put down only $206,375.
My weighted average debt cost is 7.21% + PMI cost $92,370 to service.

I will owner occupy it, obviously, as a condition of FHA, but to compare apples to apples CoC is 14.97% if non owner occupied. 

Or I can cash flow $20,474 a year and live for free in one unit.

So the deal looks pretty amazing, right? 

If rates don’t go up, my plan would be to refinance another 4-unit building into owner occupied conventional, saving 1% interest and increasing flow by another $2,100 each year! 

My income is high and safe enough that I could pay the note on all 16 units from my income alone if they all suddenly got vacant. No risk there. 

Just one huge problem. Not enough money to put down…

I need $11,375 down on building 1 with FHA and $65,000 in each of 3 buildings with 20% down + closing costs, for a total of $245K. 

I have about $120K available. So I would be happy to buy 2 buildings, 1 FHA and 1 conventional. But they are selling all 4 together only. 

So I am trying to work out seller financing. Any tips on how to creatively structure the deal? 

Another good thing is that the wholesaler seems kind of desperate.  He was asking $1.4M with quick closing, now he asked if $1.3M would work, and I asked for 6-8 weeks to close, and for seller financing. He promised to come back tomorrow. 

And final concern. Why didn’t it sell?! If the numbers are so good, why didn’t someone else scoop it up?

Thankfullycash flow is not my main focus as Ihave hign w2 income.. It's in a good area(fort mill sc) Near Charlotte NC excellent schools, 10 min from amusement park, hospital,  mall, shopping.

I think it would make a great airbnb. Or midterm rental. In fact, I found an airbnb listed in community (not huge maybe 50 units total). In the past 12 months of 84 day availability  with an occupancy rate of right around 60% make 10k (airdna data). The problem I have is the HOA states short term rentals are not allowed. Only leases of 12 months or greater. So I'm not sure if HOA just foesnt know, or they aren't that serious (which would be another issue). 

Should I reach out to owner and ask a few questions,  ask HOA (potentially alerting them).?"

2431,realestateinvesting,Tips talking with a private lender,"I am very close on closing on a new purchase. Originally, I was going to sell my primary home as part of the transaction as it has good equity, but I am only getting contigent offers. 

I was able to restructure my current financing to now KEEP my current home as a rental, but it is lowering the loan amount in return. 

I can come up with most of the funds needed for closing, but not all with the lowered loan amount. I am thinking private money is my best option at this point. 

Will private lenders want to know about the current purchase? Should I be prepared to answer questions about a business plan? Or is it only about net worth/assets, cash flow and how the numbers break down? 

The cash flow on this deal is fine, the primary lender is only giving me 25% credit on new lease income which is what is lowering the loan amount."

2433,realestateinvesting,Would liquidating stocks to buy an investment home/business be a silly idea?,"The circumstances of my life have changed drastically in the past few years and it’s time for me to buy a “forever” home. I found one that might be perfect. 

It is a 3-floor home in the center of town (good retail space):
•1st floor small apartment that can rent for 2k/mo  
•2nd floor studio space that I will use for work - conservatively will make $7,000/mo year round  
•3rd floor apartment that I will live in or rent for 3k/mo if I need a bigger space
•huge garden area to grow food  

I have money to buy this house outright, but have to liquidate stocks that are sitting roughly around where they were in 2019 (like everyone else, I lost lots of money in the market the past year) I have lost roughly what I will pay for the house. 

My income now comes from renting a house that I own that is 5 min from this home and seasonal work in the summer. This would increase my income by that $7000/mo + $2,000/mo if I choose to rent the bottom right away (don’t really need the money at the moment, so maybe I will have my mom move in to help me) 

Right now in my area I am paying $4,000/mo for a 1 bed apartment and only working seasonally because I don’t have a studio space in the winter. I own the other home that I rent outright (no mortgage) &amp; the cash purchase of this home will take 1/5 of the stock portfolio I would have to pull from. 

Is it worth it to liquidate stocks that have hugely decreased in price to make this happen, or is it best to hold off for a few more years?

Potential cons:
This house has been on the market for a year as it’s not a functional home for a family, it will only work for someone with a vision for business. My first offer (declined) was $200k less than asking because of this. They bought it for essentially what I offered them roughly 20 years ago, so it seems there isn’t much growth potential in the property value for this one, but lots of opportunity to make money from it from a business perspective + it will be harder to sell than a normal house in the area."

We would like to spend just a few months there (spring and autumn) during the year. For the rest, we will stay at home in Slovakia. We don't consider this to be an investment but rather a lifestyle thing. We also consider providing short-term rentals to cover at least some part of the expenses.

We are in touch with an international real estate agency with a local presence in Italy. They claim they will be able to take care of everything from searching for a property, through the purchase process up to property management. I am not sure if the last will be true.

We/they will need to arrange for someone to take care of the property while we will be away (regular checks, maintenance, cutting grass, taking care of the garden, ...). If we decide to provide short-term rentals (Airbnb, Booking, ...) we will need someone who will take care of all this process (check-in/out, breakfasts, cleaning, ...).

I never went to college, and am currently working on a family farm, but do not enjoy or want to invest in the farm long term.

Real estate has always sounded interesting to me. Either buying and reselling, or buying and renting.

I feel like I am in a prime opportunity for my age to start this, and want to make my money work for me so I can make even more. 

I just wondered if anyone had any advice as to what I should do with my cash. I’m getting married this year and currently have an extremely cheap place to live and we both have pretty decent vehicles. So in a perfect world I could go many years without needed to spend money on either of those things.

I don’t really know anyone personally in my area (Midwest USA) that does much real estate so im turning to the internet to see if y’all have anything good to say. 

Feel free to ask me any more questions or give any sorts of advice or direct me to places that can give me advice

I've been trying to find good real estate in my hometown, but in this economy, easier said than done. So, I started thinking of unconventional ways to purchase a home. My idea came when I was visiting my grandparents and we started talking about how their neighbors were doing. One of their neighbors, an elderly man, car had broken down and they have been giving him rides to the grocery store and to his appointments while he saves to have his car repaired. I've known him my whole life and my question this...

Is it possible to make a deal with him, say I've give him x amount of money a month while he continues to live there (his house is paid off) and when he passes the house belongs to me? I understand it can be a gamble because he can live another x amount of years. Is this ethical? Is it possible?

TL;DR Will offer to buy elderly neighbors home for x amount a month and they can continue to live there. When they pass the house will belong to me. Ethical? Possible?"

I \*think\* the answer is that the investment can start paying the pref investor after the debt service can be paid... but since the pref investment obligation includes the return of capital plus the return itself, I got confused because it would seem the priority is then:

Debt Service -&gt; Preferred return (return of capital plus accrued return) -&gt; Common equity -&gt; Debt principal (???)

2497,realestateinvesting,Our outdoor rentals do $4k/month from initial $3k investment,"Hey guys,

I wanted to share a little story as to how we're currently doing very well with Airbnb/Hipcamp and a pretty low initial investment. 

About 4 months ago we bought some plots of land near Joshua Tree off [a site that basically leases/sells super small plots of land](https://minute.land). So my company owns about 2,000 square feet in San Bernardino county. We bought 3 different dome kits from Alibaba, if you don't know what a dome kit is, it's basically a [big glamping bubble](https://s.alicdn.com/@sc04/kf/Hd120403cacd94fe88ac7e4e4df572dc6X.jpg_960x960.jpg).  

We set these up on raised wooden platforms out in the desert, and do a hell of a job marketing it on ABNB. Beautiful imagery, great copy, decent price. We're seeing about $4k a month across these 2 dome kit rentals.

We paid like $170 for the land, total. Dome kits ended up running $1.4k a piece and they're pretty sturdy and cozy. We dug an outhouse and a driveway. It's pretty crazy how quickly our listing started getting picked up on ABNB &amp; Hipcamp, and I definitely recommend looking into this if you've got cheap land near you. I suppose it works a little better out in the desert. 

Vacation rentals go crazy."

2503,realestateinvesting,"Converted primary residence to rental property in order to avoid having to sell in 2022, but what metric should I use to evaluate my investment?","Hi all- first time poster here. I converted my primary residence to a rental property in summer/fall 2022 because I wasn't pleased with the offers I got for my property when trying to sell it. It's leased up and rolling, but I'm wondering now how to evaluate the investment and whether it should be something I hold long term or liquidate when it's time to pick up and move to a larger home for my family. I'm trying to choose which metric most closely represents what I want to accomplish and could use your advice (also, it's possible I am just doing the math wrong).

Some background on the property - I purchased a single family freestanding home in July 2019 with 2 bed 1 bath 850sf in a desirable downtown neighborhood of a fast-growing US city. Purchase was conventional - 20% down on a $289,500 purchase price for a loan with a 2.99% interest rate on 30 year. In March 2022 I decided to move in with my long-term girlfriend, and after some discussion we choose to live in her apartment for a while, list mine for sale, and then take the proceeds to save/put down somewhere else. 

Because of some frustrating circumstances in March 2022, I end up not getting the sale price I wanted for my home. (I had been in contract for like $375K, but the buyer failed to get financing! After the contract fell through, rising rates took the froth out of the market, and the best offer I got from that point on was $342,000.) Rather than taking the $50k gain, I elected to convert the property to a rental in August, with the goal of retaining the asset in an arrangement that covered my carrying costs. I figured if a tenant could pay my mortgage plus a little extra, I could resell when the market became favorable again. (Whether I'll ever see that $375K price again is another question entirely, but I am going to value the property as if I ""bought"" it for $342,000 myself.)

As such, I hired a property management company and got the place leased up in about a month, and my net rental proceeds exceed my mortgage by about $300/mo. I'm now going to lay out the basics of the deal as I understand them. 

- I'm thinking my cash investment (is this equity?) is $342,000, net of the selling costs I would have incurred, and the $220K I owed as of March 22, to be about $106,000. 

- After property management fees, my current tenant generates $21,500 in net rental proceeds. I've got a vacancy allowance of 6% (I think a tenant will leave every two-three years, it will take a month to re-lease, and my PM collects a fee for new tenants that I factored in) and a yearly maint allowance of $1,000. 

- My mortgage is $1460/mo, so $17,500 a year. About $450-500/mo of that is principal repayment, and the rest is interest, RE Tax, and insurance. 

From a cash on cash perspective, I'm spinning out something like ($21,500 - $1,300 - $1,000 - $17,500) = $1,800 a year on a cash investment of $106K, which looks pretty bad! 

My questions are as follows: 

- Am I wrong to evaluate with cash flow instead of net income? I feel like, at a minimum, I should be adding back principal repayment ($5-6K/yr) to get to a net income that's closer to $7500-$8000, which looks a lot more like 7% a year. 

- Is it silly to use the 2022 offer as a valuation event? Using my initial cash outlay to evaluate the entire ownership of the project- primary residence and rental- means that I'm NOI'ing $7500-$8K on my initial down payment + closing costs of like $63,000. Those are the traditional inputs in an ROI calculation - NOI over historical cost. BUUUUUUT, the gains I could realize by selling it are way more real than a Zillow listing- I had an offer in hand, and by turning it down, I made a conscious decision to pivot to rental. 

Would love your thoughts on this. Let me know if I'm way out of bounds on rules."

2505,realestateinvesting,"Alternative paths to getting into real estate aside from saving up 20% for a down payment? (ie borrow down payment, real estate investing sites, other ideas)","&amp;#x200B;

Hello

I am looking to get into real estate investing, especially now that rates came down slightly and prices in my area came down quite a bit. First, some general information about me and my situation

\-wife and I are 32 years old

\-combined income of $185,000

\- We have $150,000 saved ($40k in short term accessible savings/investments)

\-roughly $80-100k equity in our home, factoring in current comps in our neighborhood (loan/balance equity is about $30k)

\-we were grad students, so this developed in the last 4-5 years.

\- we plan to have a child in a couple of years

I want to start building some additional streams of income at some point. Ideally, at least one additional stream before our first child arrives. I want to purchase a rental on my own or potentially with a partner who is a good friend, assuming we can come to an arrangement that works for both of us. I know this is delicate but refrain from opining on this (partner/friend) unless it pertains to getting down payment funds. I don't want to get too off-topic.

Anyways, I am fairly comfortable leveraging debt to continue building my wealth, as it would help keep more money liquid and in my pocket, especially when the baby arrives in a couple years. Has anyone taken a non-traditional path to obtain their downpayment funds to keep more money in their pocket? I'd even be okay with a smaller cash flow, knowing I have to pay off the down payment also, knowing rent will cover all my expenses and build equity in the house.

Also, I'm open to suggestions for other ways to get involved in real estate if you have suggestions . I've looked at sites like fundrise, rootstock, cadre, etc. Some apply, and some don't, as I am not an accredited investor.

Thank you for your input. Also, if this is a bad idea at the moment and I should wait longer, please let me know."

2508,realestateinvesting,Commercial property not in adequate condition for new lease," 

So  this isn’t my problem. This is two local people that I know who are  going through something of a dispute about a commercial space that one  leased to the other. I’m not planning on getting involved, and I’m not  asking for legal advice, would like to know the answer for my own  benefit.

One party leased a  downtown building with a small storefront and large warehouse to  somebody else who wants to use it for firearm manufacturing in assembly,  and the retail store front would be where he runs his business out of.  The space was previously leased to a boutique shop that use the back  area for storage. The new tenant and the landlord signed a lease  together, and after the old tenant left, and the space was cleaned out,  the landlord gave the new tenant a key. He went over and saw that there  was major water damage to the warehouse area and extensive mold inside  the walls. He hasn’t moved anything in and is afraid to do so because of  the risk of damage to his inventory and equipment.

Landlord  doesn’t want to make any repairs and has said that if the spaces in  suitable for him he may cancel. Landlord has sent him a lease  cancellation, which he has so far refused to sign. My understanding is  that the lease requires the landlord to maintain the physical structure  of the building and the tenants responsibility is the interior.

So, if we accept all of this at face value… I have a few questions.

1. does  the tenant have legal rights to sue the landlord for material damages  because he was unable to assume the lease because of the performance of  the landlord?
2. what can the landlord do if the tenant simply refuses to sign the cancellation?

Before  anybody asks, I’m not at all trying to get involved in this. I’m a  landlord in town and have other commercial space but I will not rent to  this tenant because he is looking for manufacturing space and I only  have retail store front. I told him I won’t permit him to manufacture  anything inside the retail space because it will bother the other  tenants. This other building is actually perfect for him and we live in a  small town. There are not so many other options. I’ve actually been  looking with him because I would be willing to buy a building and lease  to him. The building he was in is being sold, and he hast to be out by  the end of the month. So he has very few options."

2516,realestateinvesting,Evaluating an investment property - how to properly vet numbers?,"I currently rent my home and make a pretty moderate amount of money ($40k per year, ish). Hopefully that will change this year, but that's where I'm currently at. My city is MCOL bordering on HCOL, where 1000 foot condos in the middle of downtown can run about $500k.

There's a property I've had my eye on for a few years that didn't quite make sense, originally listed at $300,000 for 2500 square feet (or 150k each per each of the two units that make it up) about as close to the center of downtown as possible. This was recently slashed down to $140k, or $70k each, when the interest rates went crazy. I've gotten some contracting quotes and walked through the property, and the preliminary realtor quotes are pretty in line with the general contractor estimates. To furnish and get the property up to code would cost about $125k for each half (I could save $25k if I effectively made my half bare minimum livable while furnishing half for rental). This would be about 390k total, with some price cushioning built in - it's unfinished and prior owner f---ed up the floor so $25k per unit is undoing prior work to do it properly.

I can more than afford the minimum down payment (could probably put up to 50k towards it without touching safety buffer), have some routes to temporarily take on a lot of work to cover any discomfort, and once a tenant is in place at market rates they would likely absorb about 55% of the monthly payment at $1500 a month. Barring major construction catastrophe there would likely be a good return on investment for the renovation as well. I've tried running all the metrics I could find involving gross rent/capital returns/etc. and it seems decent - am I missing anything major? I feel like there has to be some massive factor here I'm overlooking. Rent increases are slowly strangling me as my city gets more popular so I'm intrigued by the possibility of an alternative."

2519,realestateinvesting,Refinance or flip?,"My partner and I are looking at a wholesale deal now.

We estimate purchase price + closing costs ~$59300, and a rehab cost of $25,000. 

All in $84300, ARV $130,000.

If we sell, suppose closing costs $13,000 and holding costs $2000, we make $30700 net. 

Obviously something could go wrong, but looks like we have a lot of space to work with unless we are missing something big (inspecting it tomorrow).

This is a cash buy so no interest costs etc.

Now suppose it appraises at $130K as we plan. We could then pull out the original $84300 and keep $45700 of equity minus closing costs.

Our calculations are that after the note, maintenance, vacancies, and all other expenses we will cash flow $3800 a year with 0 dollars in the deal.

So would you prefer to sell for $30,700 profit in 3-4 months and move on to another deal, or cash flow $3800 with no money in the deal and $40,000 of equity? 

Likely we cannot expect further appreciation for a while. Or maybe matching inflation. 

I assume we could decrease closing costs a bit by selling without an agent."

2556,realestateinvesting,Can I afford to invest in a rental property?,"My husband and I are considering investing in a rental property in North Carolina. The goal would be for the property to pay for itself and we would use it a few times a year when not rented out . Ideally once it’s payed off, we would like to use the money to invest in a nicer property that we would use as a private vacation home down the line. We were pre approved on a second home in our area last year that was listed at 350k so I know we would be approved for at least that much, and that is about the max we can afford for the down payment. 
My question is, can we afford it and is it worth wiping out most of our savings to do? To provide some more background info, we own our primary residence free and clear, which is valued at around 550k. We have about 450k in retirement and about $100k in savings. No debts. Would it be worth it to wipe out say 75k of our savings to make the down payment? We have spoken with a management company who is estimating the property in this price range would bring in about 30-35k revenue (after their fee). We are not looking to get rich off of this, but to acquire the property with hopes it will pay for itself and in 10-15 years we end up with the vacation home we desire. TIA."

2561,realestateinvesting,At what point is a larger downpayment not worth it? (20 year strategy question),"New investor who would love thoughts about our “back of a napkin” plan for property acquisition plus a question about larger down payments. 

If you need to put a larger downpayment (say 30-40%) on a property in order to make it cash flow positive, at what point is it not considered worth it on a cash on cash return perspective? Especially if the plan is to pay the mortgage off in 15 years.

Our planned strategy: (hasn’t been tested yet)

Currently, early 40s couple, primary SFH paid off.

Over next 10 years, acquire max of 5 SFH rental properties in area we’ll be retiring to. (out of state, prop manager required)

Will be able to put 20-40% down per property depending on how the numbers work out.  

Cash flow not needed for living so will go towards prop. maintenance and paying extra towards principal.

Ages 50-60 pay off mortgages or get as close as possible.  Downshift our working hours for more freedom.

Retirement base expenses provided by pension and property cash flow.  Plus hobby income. 

Anything else provided by retirement accounts.

Our goal behind wanting rental properties is for them to be a steady-ish monthly income in retirement and diversify our index fund retirement portfolio.  So we’ll use leverage initially to get properties but don’t plan on keeping 30 year mortgages on them.

Any tips, strategy review, or mentions of things we haven’t thought of is welcome."

2565,realestateinvesting,Single Family or MultiFamily purchase? New to investing," 

Hello all! I a single mom (39f), Veteran, student, Hairstylist, and homeowner living on the West Coast. seeking to get into real estate investing. I have done research, but I am no expert. I purchased a home during the 2000 housing bubble crisis and my home ended up in foreclosure, so I have watched the market carefully since. 

My now home is 285k @ 2.25% mortgage $1400 per month with taxes and insurance, worth $400k, can fetch $2000-2200 monthly rent, per lender. Cash flow approximately $400-$550 after management fees/water/sewage.

I am looking at two options for investing. My lender is running numbers for me now.

&amp;#x200B;

* Purchase and move into a single family using the rest of my VA entitlement with a 3-2-1 buydown loan guestimating 5-5.5%  on a $430k. Refi the new home in a year or so, rinse and repeat. I would be paying $1700 mortgage the first year increasing to $2178 the third year, hopefully rates will have dropped by the time so I can refi by the third year, but if not, it is what it is.

or

* get a 4 plex in a less than desirable but fairly safe area @$500k also offered in a 3-2-1 buydown guestimating 5-6%, 'live' in one of the units for one-two years, refi and purchase a second sf and move in it.   Per Seller, operating expenses $1000 pr month,  Rents total $4500 per month currently, projected to be $5400 with market increases. buydown mortgage payments of $1800 the first year, $2700 the third . this would give me a net positive cash flow of $1400 per month at current rents, and $1800 the third year using projected rents. I would live in it part of the first year, if I did my rent would be covered and I'd still cash flow $200 a month.  

  
I wanted to know everyone's thoughts, obviously the second option sounds best cash flowwise, but I'd like to hear from seasoned investors. I look forward to your responses. have a great day!"

I am first time home buyer, so I am keeping my criteria simple to start with. I see that this condo in particular is:

* In a growing area so seems like a prime location, centrally located in the city. Walking distance to many attractions in the area. I can expect this property to appreciate faster as such?
* Appears to be on one of the higher floors, those are easier to sell I hear?
* It has enough room for a single person with a minimalist lifestyle
* The interior is very modern 
* The Amenities are nice, but HOA Dues seem pretty high. For Atlanta I have seen a range of $50-300 in dues in my one day of research, so maybe this is expected"

2570,realestateinvesting,Advice: This is the year to unload your rural RV parks.,"I'm mainly located in Texas so other areas may be different.

Over the past couple years the two main investments I've seen with the highest ROIs were Mini Storage facilities and RV parks. 

The RV parks were a good investment in part because they're cheap and easy to put in and you can generate a lot of money from each site, especially if you allow tiny homes. Many people moved here to escape high rents in town or because they straight up can't afford anything else. 

However, because they're cheap and easy to put in that means that everyone else is doing it too and the market is about to get saturated. In my tri-county area alone there's at least 6 large RV resorts that I'm aware of that are going to flood the market with empty sites for people. So the days of 100% occupancy and waiting lists are likely coming to and end. Use your last couple years P&amp;Ls to sell for as much as you can before the gravy train runs out. 

The only way I see around it would be to transition to a tiny-home community and keep rents as low as possible to encourage long term tenants."

2585,realestateinvesting,Ex tenant called me “with a deal”,"Today I had a tenant from a long time ago call me with a proposition.

She found a property for a little under $300k that she liked. I was told that I should buy the property and rent to them. They would pay me $1,000 per month and also cut the grass.

Now the kicker, this is a tenant that I previously had to chase down for rent every single month, moved out with no notice, had the police at the property several times, would call me to ask if she could borrow money because she was low (while behind on rent), and moved several people in without notice. She lived in a property with rent that was sub $1,000 per month.

At first I tried to explain how that would not work and was a horrible “deal” as I would just lose money on this. I was told that since “I make more money than I know what do with” that it wouldn’t hurt me to do that and I should do the deal to be supportive. According to her, I did not need to rent properties to profit and it shouldn’t be allowed anyway.

I laughed a little as I was not really sure I could follow the logic but whatever. I tried explaining that I would just go spend my money to have a good time with my family if I was trying to lose money, not pick up actual work.

I was kind of surprised by the discussion but then again, I wasn’t.

2602,realestateinvesting,Ghetto/Section 8 properties,"Does anyone buy cheap properties in bad areas to rent to Section 8?

I had a wholesaler post a contract and reached out to them. This is in St. Louis, in a bad area.

Purchase price $44500 cash, 2 weeks ago signed a lease for $900 to a section 8 tenant.

I need to find out how much exactly does section pay, and which part the tenant is responsible for (because likely you won’t see this part), but let’s assume it’s $900 from Section 8.

The property was just fully rehabbed and passed section 8 requirements last month.

The numbers obviously look amazing.

$44500+ 4% closing costs = $46300 all in.

Suppose $10,800 rent, 10% vacancy, 10% maintenance, 5% property tax, 5% insurance, 4% water and trash, I get $7350 NOI or a 15.88% cap rate.

I always thought you couldn’t get a loan below $100K, but actually there is a lender willing to lend on it!

But even all cash it’s 16% a year + depreciation. If I really could finance it, 36% CoC.

I have a friend who has had 2 section 8 properties in another bad area of St Louis for 10 years and couldn’t be happier. Zero upkeep and easy money. Tenants never call. 

My understanding of risks:

1) small cash flow in $ = one bad thing goes wrong and it’s wiped out;
2)likely a bad tenant, so I am good if they stay for years, but if they leave in a year, might need to rehab;
3)sketchy to manage these tenants. It’s literally the highest murder per capita place in the nation.
4)obviously no appreciation, but with good cash flow I don’t care.

Potential upsides:

1)maybe tenant is afraid to wait in line for another section 8 property and stays forever; 
2)if section 8 pays the whole $900 then no late payments. 

Sure it’s risky, but potentially very profitable?

The house was built in 2020 and is 4 bed, 3 bath with an upstairs (2,400 sq ft).

We didn’t quite like the yard and did find another house we liked so we are considering renting this one out. The property manager we liked is 10% and our projected rent plus the 10% would leave us with $640 net positive per month, so $7,680 a year before any fixes, property management fee for new tenenats, etc. 

Is $640 month a good return? On paper it seems like it could be but an am amateur in this game.

My wife and I have thought about this ever since our neighbors 2 doors down moved 6 months ago and rented their house. They left due to reassignment (Air Force) and have (essentially) the same house. I saw several groups of people looking at their house 3 weeks after they left, so it definitely got interest. They’ve had a tenant for 5 months now.

I guess my biggest holdback is fear that I won’t find a renter, which is odd bc it’s a newer house in a great neighborhood with 2 pools, workout place and a great school on the outskirts of the neighborhood.

I’ve looked on Zillow and seen 5-6 rentals in the neighborhood open for about a month. Is it a valid fear to think I might not find someone for months?"

What about private investors. Is it a requirement to have a contract with property buyer before getting investors? Or is it just ""very nice to have"" but not a must?

Thanks"

What methods all are valid &amp; legal, for example can I:
-evict one unit to live in
-claim a relative wants to move into a unit
-claim major repairs which requires the tenant to leave

2634,realestateinvesting,(NY) Criticize My Math on Buying A Vacation Home For Investment/Pleasure,"Repost from /r/RealEstate as this sub is more active.

I’m at the point of seriously considering buying a vacation home with the intention to rent it out during the year through a management company, and using it for myself once those expenses are covered. The twist is that I’m currently a renter in NYC and have no interest in purchasing in the city I live in. 

On a scale of 0 - idiocy, please tell me your thoughts on my calculations. Here is the baseline:

Current savings: $250k liquid, $200k illiquid (retirement)

Current income: $300k (min) to $400k/year

Monthly take home: ~ $14k after filling out retirement accounts before bonus


Rent and other non-negotiable monthlies: ~$2,500

Typical spending habits: ~$3,000 monthly 


Target property asking price: $1M

Planned down payment: $200k

Mortgage size: $800k

Target Rate: 6.0%

Monthly payment: $5,000 

Insurance, Utils, Tax: ~$1,000 /month (low tax area)


Potential rental income: $70k - $90k/year (based on property’s current rental income)

Management Company fee: 15%


In summary, purchasing this property would take out my liquid savings in the short run, however my monthly income can cover both rent and the mortgage comfortably if there are issues with finding holiday renters. In the ideal case, the rent would cover all expenses and allow for a small profit while giving me a month of vacation time for myself, while building equity (the benefit increasing each year).

2641,realestateinvesting,Tips/Secrets for projecting High-Return Rental Properties,"I'm a mortgage banker and advocate of building wealth through real estate. Over the past 12 years, I've acquired 4 properties (most as primary purchases converted to investments) but I've certainly learned a lot of lessons that have altered my theories in determining highly successful rental properties.

My hopes were to share my opinions/theories, successes/disappointments and hear others stories in effort to continually improve my knowledge.

In determining potential rental properties, here are the main factors I look for:

* **Low Maintenance:** Minimal Services needed (landscape/pool/etc)
* **Age of Property:** Newer the better, typically my cutoff is 10 years (less likely for breakdowns)
* **Low Taxes/HOA/Condo Fees:** Obviously helps the Cash-Flow numbers
* **Fast Growing Area:** Land Development Reports, Job/Population Reports, etc
* **Supply/Demand:** How many available rental properties in that area? Low Vacancy
* **Return on Investment:** Acquisition Cost vs Annual Projected Income
* **Tenant Majority Market:** Greater amount of low cost, 20-35 yr old renters (vs Million $ SFH renter)
* **Distance from Residence:** I now manage ALL my properties so being able to drive vs fly to turnover/make small repairs/etc helps save my time and money

These factors have led my last 2 investment properties to be Townhomes. Another little-benefit with Townhomes (and Condos) is the homeowners insurance is typically about half what a SFH's policy is. Additionally, townhomes have lower HOA fees then Condos and appreciate at a much higher rate.

Anyone else have some excellent tips/secrets/theories they look for while identifying successful investment properties?"

2644,realestateinvesting,"UK HMO Landlords who provide bills included, I have a question for you regarding home workers","Pre-covid it was the norm to expect anyone renting a room from you to be out at work all day, and all bills included was quite manageable as the costs were relatively low too.

I had a lodger move in during covid, who chose my room because of its vicinity to their office - walking distance. Of course, throughout covid I was fine with them working from home as it was expected, and energy was relatively cheap.

Now, however, the pandemic is past and they continue to work from home every day. For the most part I wouldn't have minded if we weren't going through an energy crisis or if it wasn't summer - but the home is heated electrically and they like to keep warm. I am paying significant extra costs through the winter (I estimate an additional £90-£150 a month just for their extra usage) because they don't want to walk 10 minutes to their office and work there instead.

They are a good tenant though, are very clean and respectful and always pay on time.

So, questioning UK HMO landlords - do you find yourself facing similar situations? What's your policy regarding working from home in this new era in cases where all bills are included?

We're facing the end of the current government subsidies on energy prices too. The cap without the subsidy is more than a doubling of the current rate. I'm trying not to get too far ahead of myself here but if this happens then I'll be going from renting rooms out at near break-even through the winter to making a loss, and this extra day use is just the cherry on the cake."

2652,realestateinvesting,Property Investment Advice," 

Hi there,

Hope someone will be able to give me some good advice. Moving to Massachusetts (very expensive RE market) in the next few months. Partner and I will bring in 325K (215K and 110K) income combined. We currently have around 70K in liquid savings. We don't want to tie ourselves to a mortgage that's too high, as we don't know how long we'll have this income (maybe for max 2-3 years).

What advice would you give in this situation.

My thoughts are :

1. Purchase first property (around 500-600k), save some money on rent, reduce taxes slightly (through mortgage interest). This price range is high for us and somewhat risky, however it does help reduce our taxes.
2. Rent in Mass, purchase a few cheaper turnkey property (60-100k range) in cheaper, developing real estate markets (ex. Arkansas) and rent them out.
3. Invest all savings into REIT, pay rent and live without the stress.

Have no prior experience in real estate.

Thanks for your time and any suggestions."

2661,realestateinvesting,Case study: Seattle fourplex BRRRR into a fiveplex,"I came across this real estate investing group in Seattle that does fix &amp; flip as well as BRRRR projects through equity funding partners that want to invest in the group.

I'll attach the PDFs they sent me but the thing that is a little suspicious to me is that they claim that by doing some light renovations and redoing the layout which costs $185k, they'll add $1.5M worth of equity to the property. Granted, they are turning a fourplex into a fiveplex and adding some bedrooms to the existing units, but they're not increasing the square footage of the property.

&amp;#x200B;

That kind of return seems unrealistic to me but I'm also new to this space. Is this typical of the kind of returns that people are seeing? Even in this current market?

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue I had was that they were offering me 10% of the LLC that owns this property for my $100k investment, valuing this project at $1M. They did put $250k down for a seller-financed loan, but even $250k + $100k = $350k. Does that mean that the $650k of equity is what their management fee is in the form of sweat equity? I understand they work hard and they're the ones that found the opportunity off market, but that's a hefty fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is a new space for me and because of all the uncertainty and questions I had I ended up not investing my $100k in this project. I'm curious to hear what people think about this?"
2662,realestateinvesting,Start early or masters?,"I am a senior in my undergrad (21M) and going to graduate soon. 

Option 1: Got an SWE job for 90K base, and I can go with them. Let's say I stay with them for the long term, I could expect a 2-3% raise in base salary every year. 40 hours a week, chill job. I can also start house hacking right away and start my first RE investment.

Option 2: Go for my masters. The program I want to do costs around 80K(just tuition, could be lot more with living expenses), and the average salary coming out from that is 250-300K. Very competitive and will take lots of my time. The job is high-stress and around 60 hours a week. The role is Quant Researcher for those that want to know. Masters program is 2 years.

So if I go for option 2, opportunity cost is 90k + 90K + 80K = 260K for the first two years. However, I will make significantly more from option 2 later on, and it is a clear winner for the long term, assuming I want to work for long term, but I want to retire early. 

If I want to retire as soon as possible, spending 260K on investing (real estate) vs spending it on a degree can have a big difference, as my investments would compound over time and I can get started early. If I invest right, I can probably retire by age 30 and focus full-time on real estate. However, if I can't retire by 30, and have to work more years, then option 2 makes a lot more sense. Am I dreaming too big to think I can retire by 30 from real estate?

I want to start them off with just building a custom wood bed frame for me. This way, it’s trial run for the both of us. I will set up a separate bank account, give them a Home Depot credit card, give them plans for the build, work out payment and estimate timelines.

I am relocating to Fort Worth, TX, in May for a new position that pays significantly higher than my current salary. I’m head of the household with three dependents (ages: 2,5, 31). We don’t plan on purchasing a home in TX due to the current economic environment.

Currently living paycheck to paycheck with no cash flow or capital expenditures to finance any operating expenses associated with owning a rental property. I thought about opening a home equity line of credit to finance operating costs. Or taking a loan against my 401k. Again, I would like some feedback and insight on the idea. I provided some details below.

* **Home purchased:** $243,000
* **Owe:** $210,000

2689,realestateinvesting,First property - is it too small? (In Sweden),"TL;DR: Looking at first property (in Sweden) that will cash flow $1.5k/yr on $7.5k down. I have $70k in liquid savings and make $200k per year. Should I go bigger?

As per the title - looking at my first property, a condo (1b1b, 600sqft) in my small home town in Sweden (about 20k in population), with the aim to buy and rent.

Stats (local currency converted to USD):
Purchase price - $50k
Down payment - $7.5k (15%)
Mortgage - $42.5k at ~3.5%, 3% amortization per year

Monthly payments:
HOA fees: $230
Principal repayment: $80
Interest: $90
Estimated rent: $530

Income tax is not applicable as some default deductions are enough to offset the income, and property taxes are included in the HOA fee.

Now, one part of me feels this is just too small and not worth the hassle, and another part thinks that I need to start somewhere and that this is a better return than my savings account. What is the right answer?

Would love to hear thoughts from more experienced people, and happy to provide any more info that could be helpful.

Additional info:

With these stats the cash flow would be $1500/yr (21% CoC), and including the payback equity the return would be $2500 (33%). This is before any maintenance.

The place is in very good condition with new full kitchen installed in 2020. Only expect to need a repaint of the bedroom/living room as the current color is horrendous. Don’t expect any signficant problems, and Swedish property standards are generally very high.

I live in London myself, working in finance and have been able to save up ~70k after my first 18 months and am currently making ~200k all-in. I have friends and family at hand in my hometown to help with anything needed regarding the condo."

2691,realestateinvesting,All in One Rental Property Software for a Growing Portfolio,"Hello everybody! This subreddit was has been **amazing** in answering questions and I have yet another one. Thank you in advance for reading and replying.

Some personal background info: Purchased my first triplex in 2021, settling on a 10 unit apartment building next week. I have not been using any software for my triplex except PDFFiller to fill out the leases. Everything else I've done manually such as picking up rent, texting tenants on my personal number, keeping tenants updated on things using my personal number, manually keeping receipts, etc.

I would really like to change this using software and elevate the way I handle my portfolio. Here is the list of things I would like the software to do:

\- Tenants having their own portal to pay rent electronically (with multiple different ways of paying such as, bank account, credit/debit card, etc)

\- Tenants being able to reach me through the software. Including them being able to request general maintenance OR emergency maintenance whether that means I get an email from the software OR if the software has its own chat set up (preferred).

\- Me being able to communicate with tenants directly through the software. This can be a direct chat setup within the software, OR be able to send emails to the tenant(s)

\- Send the same email to multiple tenants at once.

\- Being able to easily create new leases where the software has me inputting the information but the software takes that information and automatically puts it where it needs to go in the lease, OR have a standard lease (where I can also make adjustments according to the property) and tenants can log into their portal to input their information.

\- Upload and keep track of receipts, important documents, per property, and maybe more specifically, per unit/tenant.

\- Upload and keep track of tenants private information, their ID Cards, and anything else that is required for that specific tenant.

\- This software preferably must be able to handle logging in with ONE login, but having different different portals/links for the different properties. I do not want them getting intertwined. (I may be asking for a lot, but I like to keep things organized with as little different portals/softwares/different technologies as possible).

\- Easily adding a new property and being able to organize documents for that specific property, have new leases for the tenants that they can fill out on their own and electronically sign.

I really am not sure if this is asking for too much or if there are softwares out there that are able to accommodate all of these wants. The reason for excessive organization is I am a full time student and also have a job, planning on doing an internship this summer. 

**I would really like this to be a software that anyone can log into and easily take over (or get a basic understanding of the portfolio) managing the portfolio without any major issues.**

To conclude, If the things that I am asking for is not realistic, how do you self manage a large portfolio while keeping everything in check and organized? Do you use different platforms for different things such as, rent payments are separate softwares, communicating with tenants are different softwares, uploading and signing leases are different softwares?

What are the seasoned and experienced investors that are self managing or used to self manage do to keep everything listed above in a portal?

**Thank you very much once again for any and all input.**"

I'm about two months away from making the decision but appreciate input. Doing a flip in Alberta and here are some quick numbers.


2 bedroom, 1 bath

1. Hold for rental (~300/month cashflow)
2. Refinance and rent (~100 month cashflow, but a lump sum returned for the next investment)
3. Refinance and AirBnb

Keeping things simple, if I net 150K from the sale, does the 1031 specialist take the entire net proceeds into escrow or JUST the 100K profit?"

2719,realestateinvesting,Water Leak From Roof Onto House - Submit Claim for Insurance?,"I have a rental I own since last year and it has been a lot of issues from day one. Last year, there were multiple water leaks throughout the house: 1) water pipe suddenly burst inside the wall; 2) hot water copper pipe burst under slab; 3) water leak from washer hookup. The first two events took place while I had a tenant in the house. The last one occurred after the tenant left and must have yanked the water hose from the hookup causing the leak. Anyhow, I submitted an insurance claim when the hot water pipe burst under the slab and did some renovation in the house.

Fast forward to today, SoCal just had a severe storm/rain. My tenant informed me that there was significant water leak under the window frame this past weekend. In addition, there were multiple water leaks from the ceiling in various parts of the house (bathrooms/bedrooms) and from the patio sliding door. I had a roofer come out today and found out that the underlayment paper of the roof tile had deteriorated, hence causing water to leak. This happened in a lot of areas of the roof. He would remove the tiles and put in new underlayment paper, then put back the old tiles (and replace new ones that had cracked). He estimated that it would cost around $9k. This is a 2 story house roughly around 3k square feet.

Question:

1. Should I submit a claim for the water leak from this rain damage to my insurance given my history? Inside the house there were multiple leaks, and I'm hoping this will dry out? I hate for my insurance premium to go up significant because of another claim that I'm submitting
2. Has anyone experience this type of situation before with a tenant living inside the house? I'm trying to make it right for the tenant. How would you approach them?
3. Weather is clearing out for the next few days. Wanted to take care of this problem as soon as possible, so any other suggestions you can provide is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you!"
2720,realestateinvesting,What does a high end flipper tend to expect in profit?,"I checked the rules and think I'm following them. Apologies if not.

I'm not a real estate investor--in fact I'm on the other side. I was looking at buying an older house in a fairly popular part of Los Angeles to live in, but got beat out by a flipper/investor. They bought for $2 million and through the grapevine I heard they expect to sell it for $2.8 million in 6 months after fixing it up. Seems a bit wild, but that's the LA real estate market for you. 

My question is, is there any basic way to gauge what a flipper expects to make in profit? The house is from the 1930s and most of it has not been updated since the 1970s.  They are going to have to do a really major kitchen overhaul, likely add a bathroom upstairs, probably open up some walls in the kitchen as well as upstairs to create a master bedroom area, redo the other bathroom upstairs, and make lots of other cosmetic updates. 

I'm wondering if I could offer them something close to their profit margin to get the house, but have no idea if that's like $100k, $200k, $400k, or what. If it is on the lower end and something I could swing, I figure it would be a win-win since I'd get a house I want and they'd get their profit or close to it, and could get money now instead of in 6+ months, as well as minimize the risk that the house wouldn't sell for their expected price.

If anyone has experience on expectations on the high-end flip market, would love to know how y'all operate!"

2722,realestateinvesting,Question - sell our rent current home?,"Hi everyone - looking for informative opinions on our situation.

Current home - 
Purchased Early 2019 $360,000, currently owe $320,000 at 2.6% with monthly escrow and HOA payment of $1770 in desirable neighborhood of a suburb of a major metro. New house built in 2019 so no major concerns with roof, foundation, etc. HOA handles landscaping for front yard, backyard is drip system, turf and pavers so almost no maintenance. 

Option A:
We can rent this home for approximately $2200-$2500 per month, and know someone interested that is trusted with stable income so we can skip the property management company and just offer at $2200. 

Option B:
We can sell in a declining market, but again still a desirable area. Selling price would probably be $515,000 to $540,000 in the current market. Similar homes in the neighborhood were selling at $680,000 in late 2021, so we have realistic/low expectations with the above numbers. 

So do we capitalize on the equity now or keep the house a few years, knowing we can sell within 5 years of moving and avoid capital gains tax or do we get into the rental game and start building some passive income?

My spouse and I are in our mid 30s, decent 401K accounts ($160k), cash savings of $90k so far for the new house down payment, but need $112k by close date in June. (Already gave builder $72,000 cash for earnest and upgrades)

Income and current bills info:
Combined yearly pretax income - $350k to $450k ($230k to $330k commission sales fluctuate for one income, the other is stable $120k) 
Auto loans and car insurance- $1830/month - two vehicles 
Daycare - $2800/month 
Current Mortgage/escrow/hoa - $1770/month
Phones, streaming apps, and internet - $350/month

We’ve scheduled a meeting with a tax and financial advisor for next month where we’ll also ask questions, but what are the advantages and disadvantages for property management from an income and tax perspective that are major factors we should consider?

Generally we are low risk type people, both grew up in low income environments so we haven’t really seen good financial modeling or have any family to advise or ask, hence Reddit. 

The why: 
We are moving into a bigger home because we are about to become a family of 5 and current house is a 3 bed 2 bath 1565 sqft house where we wfh - it has been just fine for two kids (no guest room, no dining room, no playroom, no separate offices, just all in the kitchen/dining/living spaces) but with three we are going to be a little too tight - so life happens. 

New house - Assuming $20% down. 
Loan of $730k at 5.25% (no buy down)
Mortgage/escrow/hoa - $5025/month

If we max the down payment to 27% that monthly payment drops to $4675/month - without losing the jumbo loan locked in rate of 5.25 from last year - $665k loan. 

Is that enough detail? What would financially savvy individuals do?"

Want to confirm this is correct or any ways to avoid this if I did NOT claim any depreciation during ownership.

2.   I’m aware of the larger costs during a sale of investment property I can offset the gains with: seller/buyer commissions, other selling fees, prep fees (like staging), etc. Any other more items that come to mind?

My family and I moved out of the condo when we had another addition and have been renting a large house outside the city, we got a large dog too.

We currently have 150k and would love a principal to call our own but by keeping my condo we’re only approve for about 600K and we can’t get anything other than some run down duplexes or new ikea style built townhouses crammed in rows without greenery. DON’T WANT TO SELL CONDO! 

I’m thinking if we can make a similar monthly return we keep renting the house (almost at 3 years of renting now though) for a while longer given the market may drop and buy another condo in another downtown core for the fully furnished model. We’d have 2 revenue streams.

My wife and I are both game but not having a principal with a baby and another one coming shortly is a bit worrying. 

But…a second rental with over 1k return monthly would be a long time winner x2.

Me: I’d like another rental, they both make 1000-1200k monthly.

Doing that would also mean all that money would be locked into the property.

Prevailing wisdom around here says don’t invest in a property that does not cash flow

So why do you think there are so many SFH rented out in these places ? Tenants are living in a home subsidized by investors. 

Are these either 

1. accident landlords 

2. Betting on appreciation 
 
3. Bought long ago so cash flowing now

For 3 they probably may to have started with negative cash flow since rent has never covered thd home prices 

There should be no SFH available in the rental market if we were investing wisely?"

To extend such a post, I ‘d appreciate your opinions on my scenario

* For context, Moving to Canada as I got PR(equivalent of green card in the US) approved. Currently on work visa in US and faced some struggles with visa, ﻿so would ﻿like some stability. Pay will be the same (confirmed with employer), so higher pay after conversion to CAD from USD will offset the higher taxes.
* Can come back in 4 years if I want after securing Canadian citizenship
* Current home bought March 2022 @ 500k. **20 year** Mortgage PITI - $3200 (rate of 3.375)
* Even if home sells for $500K(which I doubt given current economy), will take around 50k loss assuming 10% transaction cost
* Rents in my area range between 2500 - 3000 for similar homes. Averaging to $2700 rent and 5% vacancy, 5% Capex, 10% property manager costs, ﻿net rental income is $2160 and big negative cash flow of around $1000
* If we were to live off this $2160 as rent in Canada, conversion around 2800 CAD - lets say we only rent for 2500CAD. 
* It is as if we are still here paying off our primary home with payment of $3200, but living away renting someone else's place. As the market recovers in the next few years, we take a call - ﻿either to sell at higher price or keep renting the place and keep building equity faster due to 20 year mortgage. If it were a conventional ﻿30 year, mortgage would have been around $2800."

I‘m from Germany and own a few rental properties (long-term and short-term) there. So I kinda know a bit about real estate investing. Nonetheless, I do see myself as pretty much at the start. Especially in terms of investing in the US. 
I have history in the Henderson/Las Vegas, NV area and would love to start investing in rental properties there. Germany is killing me with taxes on taxes on taxes….(I know there’s no paradise but the US does seem to attract more investors while Germany is at the moment doing everything to give people the urge to leave). 
Does anyone have any idea how to begin? Sure first step is finding the right setup (LLC, etc.) and talking to an attorney and CPA, but are here any foreigners who can tell me how they started and if it is really possible to earn a passive income with rental properties such a single family and multi-family homes as a foreigner. I would be thankful for any tips (books, people, etc.) and experiences. Also when having rent come in on one hand and paying fees for LLC, taxes, property management, mortgage, etc. on the other - is there really that much left? What is it that makes the investment worth it? Living off passive income such as rent used to be back in the day. How does this work? Equity? Tax breaks that only exist in the US?
Sorry for all the questions but I‘m trying to read every book and can’t seem to find a satisfying answer. 

Thanks for your feedback. 

Cheers from Germany"

Do you look for someone local you can sit across a desk from? If I went this route, I'd likely check with other nearby investors, property managers, investing focused real estate agents, etc. for recommendations.

Do you look for one of the online-focused firms who will work with you via web-meetings? As we move towards an increasingly remote-working economy I find this is the way I operate in my 9-5 and it may be easier with regard to scheduling and open things up to more competing firms.

They neglected most maintenance repairs and never updated things that should have been updated to begin with. Sorry for this long post but I wanted to give as much detail as possible. 

My dad passed away a few years ago unexpectedly and now I’m kind of stuck trying to figure everything out and time is flying by.

My mom ended up getting a new house to be closer to some family because her previous primary was a bit far from a city and she’s always scared being in her own now. 

My main questions are is it worth it to fix up both homes and rent for passive income or fix up and sell for more than we would get than selling them as is? 

I think with some fixing one house could be a good rental as I hear about people asking for rentals in the area all the time. My parents originally got it for 70k in ‘93 and even in the current condition it’s probably worth a decent amount. Maybe 300k-350k? It’s on an acre about 40 miles west of Portland, OR. I was thinking about getting her to pull out a HELOC, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it for a house that might need 100k or more in renovations. I’m also young, don’t really know what I’m doing, and taking this plus everything else on day-by-day. She is not in a position to deal with any of this and it has fallen on me as the oldest kid. 

The other house is a secondary home on the Washington coast (Long Beach)…..but it’s a beat up coastal home. It’s also on a little over an acre, which I think is the only reason why it has some value. Manufactured home, but land is owned with it and it has a water view and oyster bed rights. It is on a shared easement, but there aren’t any responsibilities tied to it as someone else owns the road. We recently put a new roof on it because it desperately needed one, and my mom was being difficult and decided to keep it. Now she has gone back to possibly selling it. 

Everything has been put into a trust and I have gotten rid of some of my parents junk, but I’m worried about capital gains taxes on the previous primary if selling is the best option. I also don’t know if I want to stick around and help her long term with some of this stuff, like being a landlord, but  as I continue working in the corporate world being a landlord doesn’t sound too bad? I am currently moving closer to deal with all of the houses (I live 3.5 hours away). Anyone have similar experience or insight? 

Anything is appreciated, thank you."

2824,realestateinvesting,Inheritance: Better to split or just manage?,"Hi there!  
Me and my 2 brothers have received an ineritance, which consist of:  
A) 120m2 1F indipendent house + land (can still build residential 300m2)  
B) 100m2 2F apartment being part of small condo of 4  


House price at m2 is 2000€ atm. The goal is to divide this inheritance, so rather than holding and renting for 3, each one of us will have his part for himself.  


What's a good idea here?  
I see about getting the indipendent house from A, and leave the rest to my brothers. I would then split A into two houses of 60m2, and rent both, or rent one and live in the other.  Instead, the idea of managing all properties by the 3 of us, with the new buildings on the avaiable land, sounds like kinda difficult, and also debt intensive, but I may be wrong and it could be a good thing, considering those additional buildings are made for renting.  


I await your suggestions :)"

2829,realestateinvesting,How to find previous rent advertising for a property?,"Anyone have an tricks on how to find or know of any sites that lists previous rent rate for properties?

I'm looking at a handful of small apartment buildings right now and I have underwritten all but one of them. I'm trying to find any previous rent adverts they put out there but no luck so far. This one seems to be self managed as I checked all the local property manager websites for listings, searched any of the big available for rent websites, and even used some waybackmachine to search those sites. 

I know the people that own it have long term renters (8+ years) as two of the apartments are rented by people that are registered with the state as sex offenders which gives their address and how long they have lived there and the last check in date.

I'm short of calling those two tenants or the owner to find out, but I'm trying to find out as much about these properties as I possibly can before contacting the owners. That way I can walk into the first conversation having it as close to underwritten as possible and sound knowledgeable about their property."
2830,realestateinvesting,Becoming an owner occupant with no income,"I'm looking to go back to college full-time as an adult, but I don't want to graduate buried in debt. I have some money saved and thought I could put a down payment on a multi-family home and live in one of the units so I can retain my wealth, instead of burning through all my savings and taking out loans. 

This would be in Buffalo, NY. Looking at triplexes in the $200k range. Would put $40k down, rent out 2 units which would hopefully bring a monthly rental income of $2400. Subtracting $1500 monthly for mortgage and other expenses, that would give me a monthly profit of $900 plus a free place to live while I go to school. 

Does this plan sound realistic or am I being overly optimistic? I'm aware that vacancies and major repairs are a big financial risk, especially given that I'll be living off a small savings with no income. But could this be feasible if I find good tenants and a house that's in good condition?"

2841,realestateinvesting,Just a thought regarding capital gains taxes when selling a primary home.,"I would love to get some comments regarding this issue and a perspective I considered. With inflation the original purchase price of a home purchased let's say 40 years ago would be equivalent to much more money today. The dollar had higher purchasing power 40 years ago. 

As an example if you purchased a home in 1983 for $110,000 that $110K would be roughly $328K in today's dollars. If that is the case then why not adjust the cost basis to what it would be worth in today's dollars? That seems fair to me. Yes I understand for primary residences the first $250K to $500K in capital gains (depending on single or married status) is tax free. Still the money spent back then to purchase the home had significantly higher purchasing power than the dollars we have today. Love to see a discussion on this."
2842,realestateinvesting,Flips vs Rentals,"I’ve done 2 flips where they were complete guts and remodeled. I lived in each while I redid for 2 years to avoid capital gains tax. Did another that was new construction, just a shell and I did the electric plumbing drywall trim etc. As I did good with these, they are very labor intensive. I’m curious what the pros here think. Would doing this for rentals be more beneficial? Hire more out for write offs and pump them out more quickly? I’ve accumulated enough to buy properties without taking out a loan.

Thank you for your time and input."

This is 3/2.5, but they appraised it at 4/2, and compared it to all 4/2s.

2846,realestateinvesting,Need help understanding commercial multifamily valuations,"Background: I've been a small scale landlord for over a decade but only for under 5-unit buildings.

I seem to really be struggling to understand how larger commercial multifamily or portfolios of smaller multifamily are valued. We're able to pull off a bigger buy at this time but those deals are typically valued based off cap rate and the numbers looks pretty bad (which may just mean they're actually bad).  If I'm understanding it correctly then a 6% cap rate on a $1 million dollar property would return $60k in NOI per year(if they're being honest) and I'd be carrying around a $46,000 in interest payments so that's $14k CoC.  Understandably, we COULD be getting a 6% return if we dropped the whole million but are people really locking up that much money for those returns in this economy?  Smaller multifamily can still have around a 10+% cap rate or so if you were to calculate it so I'm thinking we may just have to buy a few separate properties.

Rhode Island has had close to 100% inflation on residential real estate and apartment rents in the past 5 years."

It was taken down because I edited it to add more details and mentioned my age. Automod said “majority of post starting with your age have been deemed low effort by the community”.

My long term goal is to own 10 paid off rental properties.

I can’t decide what to do with the money. Should I buy another rental property or pay off some high interest bills?

What I owe
$140,000 on a rental property 6.75% interest 
$50,000 personal home 5% interest 
$48,000 rental property 5.25% interest 
$30,000 home equity loan 6.5% intrest 
$38,000 on a car at 11% interest 
$17,000 student loans (deferred)
$12,000 on a car at 2.2% interest 
$6,000 to the IRS for taxes not sure the interest 

My taxes will be $15,000 this year.

For selling the land I will have to pay 15% taxes on it unless I invest in more land and I don’t want more land.

I’ve never had an accountant but I guess I need one.

Cash flow information:
Total cash flow is 400/month.
$140,000 rental is rented for 1400/month but doesn’t cash flow at all it just pays for itself, insurance on it and the $30,000 home equity loan I took out to get it.
$48,000 rental on the payment is 350 a month and it’s rented for 775 a month it cash flows is 400/month I just put in a savings account. 

Income information:
Total income around 60-80,000 a year

I’m a real estate agent so only commission. Last year I made 18,000 dollars I had some medical issues and couldn’t work as much, year before 38,000. This year I will make 16,000 in the month of February so I see myself making about 60,000 this year but it’s unpredictable.

My husband makes about 60,000 a year but is also self employed so it’s hard to predict.

Credit information:
My credit score is 720 and my husbands is 650. 
I have two cars because I signed for my husbands car. He didn’t have established credit because he’d never had a loan until he met me.
I bought my first house 8 years ago.
I’m trying to help my younger sister too and I’ve added her on my credit cards that I use and pay off each month.

2854,realestateinvesting,Cash out Refinance at a higher interest rate to purchase rentals?,"Hello everybody, I don't have anyone to personally discuss this with so I was hoping I could get some guidance through the forum. I currently own one investment property (renting for $1.6k) that I purchased 2 years ago via a VA home loan (was my primary at the time). 3 Months ago I purchased another home and have a new primary. Because of this, I am unable to pull a HELOC in Texas for the investment property, or at least I've had an extremely difficult time finding banks who are willing, due to the location, and it being on my investment property. My other option is to do a Cash-Out Refinance, however, this would mean my interest rate of 3.2% for a 175k loan would increase probably to the 6s% for maybe 225k. The reason for refinancing is that I had quite a bit of money saved from my deployment that I dumped into the principal the first year I bought the house. I owe 105k on the 175k loan. A rough estimate would be that my cash-out refinance would come out to $90K, which I can then use to purchase another rental down the road. Is this simply a math question? I'm a bit stuck as to whether or not I should refinance or just wait it out until next year when I have enough funds to purchase another rental, however in this case I could push it to 3 with me putting an extra bit of money for the third one. I did the math and on the estimates, it shows:  


OLD Loan:

CoC: $385

New loan Estimate:

CoC: $100

Possible purchases with refinance based of current market:

CoC (for 3 additional houses): $1,000

\- I also estimated the ROI and it was roughly similar if I account for 3 more homes. I live in a city of 250k and houses aren't too expensive, they've been declining in my market since last year's peak.

Also, in Texas it is incredibly hard for lenders to do HELOC's as the state law is vague and states it's not legal here. I've spoken to various lenders and bank and they all state that at this time it is not something they are willing to risk. I FOUND lenders willing to do line of credits but they're only providing it for 1 year, and I do not feel comfortable borrowing 30k+ and rushing myself to hopefully refinance in time to pay it back.

Is there something I am not seeing that I should look out for if I decide to cash out refinance? I've never done this before so maybe I'm seeing this through tinted glasses and am missing an important variable when considering this option. Thank you all!"

2863,realestateinvesting,Feedback on a property as a first primary house,"I am interested in a home which will be our first home purchase. We like the property for its lot size. I have few points on which I need more perspectives.  

a) Though the property has its own land, the type of property is condo. (141 Single Family Residence Condominium Detached). It has HOA with 2 houses (the house neighboring the one). Does the property code make a difference if the land is owned along with property by owner.

b) There is a swamp and small creek behind the house. Though the sound of creek has been laid as selling point for the house, curious if swamp close to house has any downside. The back of the house is protected green belt.

c) Though the lot size is decent, a good portion of it is covered with trees that seem to be part of swamp. There are 3 more houses on same land (only 1 of it is part of HOA), none of them have extended their fence beyond a point in the direction of swamp. How can I find out what might be the reason without talking to neighbors?
I am looking at developing the backyard to increase the value of property if I decide to re-sale, so answer to this question is important to me. 

d) It also has a public drain near the lot. Any downside of having public drain close to the lot? (can be seen in the attached survey map)

I am a wholesaler who is trying to expand their reach to clients trying to sell their home.

I was thinking about doing a similar thing with real estate in which we do partnerships with divorce lawyers where they can refer their clients to us and we can help them sell their home.

2891,realestateinvesting,"Where are you investing right now? Class A, class B, class Properties","I’ve been thinking about this a little bit lately. I am in the Midwest and class A properties are not really available due to competition from home buyers. Simply, prices are just too high to get any kind of return. Class B properties always made the best rentals anyway, but even with those I’ve seen a lot of price appreciation. 

Lately, I found myself looking at class C properties. Namely, distressed properties that are located in the city center with reasonable access to jobs. There seems to be a lot less competition here and acceptable returns.

What I keep wondering is about the effect of rent inflation. I know real inflation has peaked for the most part but I still suspect there’s going to be a lot of lag regarding rent inflation. There’s still a lot of housing shortages in my area and new construction costs are sky high. The last duplex I looked at was $265,000 and the new owner is planning to renovate can update it. The old tenants were paying $700 per month. I figured the new tenants are going to be paying almost twice that. But give it a couple years and all of these mom and pop landlords are going to have to raise prices or sell eventually, so the inventory of these really cheap homes at prices that were a bargain 10 years ago will eventually go away. So I suspect there is still going to be rental price appreciation for the next few years. 

Which brings me back to my question. The obvious place for more rentals is going to be to expand into existing housing inventory, so transitional and marginal neighborhoods are likely to improve. Which means price wise at the highest rate of return is going to be a buy and hold investment in transitional or marginal neighborhoods. Because when the average single-family home in a good neighborhood is over $300,000, there are always going to be people willing to look at a different neighborhood for half that. And I can currently buy for a 10th of that number all day long in those neighborhoods. 

Id kind of like to hear from somebody that has experience going through an inflationary period and what affect it had on gentrification and housing prices as it relates to the different types of rental properties. Anybody here care to speak on that?"

My plan is as of now to buy a quadplex using FHA 3.5% and house-hack for a few months/ years.

History:

I currently own a one bedroom condo and rent it in a downtown core which is profitable.

My family grew and we left that condo in 2020 - that’s why we’re renting, it’s a house with garage and backyard still on 2020 rent, lucky for now as rents have almost doubled since then. 

We originally wanted to get a principal for the family but houses/townhouse are STILL so expensive even with the dips, (nothing under $699k) so now we’re thinking getting another rental 1 bed could be less risk, also in a major downtown core that will be profitable. 

Most mortgage brokers wanted me to sell the condo but I won’t, it’s a business now so we’re only approved for 640k. 

This leaves us still renting with kids …but….2 secure revenue streams if we go the rental purchase route that may go forever!

It comes down to this, BUT PLEASE correct me if I’m wrong:

**Do we wait for real estate to drop even more and put the 150k into an index to make a few grande on interest while we wait …..or buy real estate now?!

Furthermore keeping a vlog hopefully attracts some useful expertise (you guys ;)
You can see it all here: https://jappie.me/summerhouse-paradis-aruba.html


I think this is interesting to share because it's not a duplex that often get recommended here, but a house on Aruba.
I've good reasons for this, relatively speaking the property over there is rather cheap, and I thought I found a deal.
It's a big house, which I can actually convert in a duplex by some tactically placed doors. But I decided against this because I want to do as little as possible, and the tourism industry is more lucrative (if I can break into it).

I think getting a price of $120 a day is definitely possible (the competition appears to be around $200), although I'm not sure if that's enough to cover costs.

If this doesn't work out I can still convert it into a duplex. So I feel it's unlikely I'll lose money on this.

Here’s my current situation:

I live in Charlotte, NC, which is booming RE-wise. Bought a 3B/2BR house January of 2021, lived in it for a yr, and am about to rent it out beginning in March. 

House 1: 
*310k remaining mortgage
*125k in equity
*3% mortgage.
*$1650 monthly payment (incl tax+ins)
*Renting out for $2650 per month
*Netting $2500 after expenses, so flowing $850.

House 2 (just purchased)
$465k purchase price
20% down (93k equity)
6% mortgage
$2540 monthly payment including tax+ins

I’m hoping to buy another investment property within the next year. I know the whole cash flow equation, but am wondering if you guys would condone taking a HELOC out to do so, or if I should use my cash on hand instead?

I’ve got $165k in cash for reference.

So, I’ve never heard of this situation before… having a year of coverage agreed upon, paid, no claims made… then this? 

The only other communication in the past with them was them threatening to drop him after the assessor(?) supposedly passed by during the time we were clearing out the overgrown shrubbery and whatnot (yard bags, etc present). In response, they said we just needed to send an updated picture of the yard. We did. All good on their end, we were told. 

We are definitely searching for a new policy with someone different. During those communications, they were extremely rude and would not return our calls. I also called separately, and we realized they were giving us different excuses- just obvious that they were dodging us.

So I have 8.5k saved up that I'm not touching, I want that to all go towards the property that I'm going to buy. Plan to save up for a few more months before getting very serious about looking at properties.

I have $500 that I stow away in a separate account for recreation and hobbies so that I don't have to touch any of my other funds.

My car insurance is 600 every 6 months and my phone bill is $100 monthly, all other monthly expenses aren't significant amounts.

Just looking for different opinions, maybe something I haven't thought of. Quick breakdown:

* Current mortgage on multi-family 2 units
* Chicago suburbs area
* Plan to rent both units netting ~$300/mo
* Late 30s, work 100% remote, net salary ~$5,000/mo, total debt (besides mortgage) $300/mo (own car, no student loans, just some CC debt)
* I have not reached my max earning potential and am working towards it
* No wife, No kids

I def want to live in Chicago for a few years on the north side. Eventually I want my 'forever' home back in the suburbs. Im set to buy a second property in 1yr and am looking at 2 options:

1. Buy a 2 Br in a desirable north side neighborhood, ~$2,500/mo. Rent it out when I move out (~4yrs) and then buy my forever home. Tough to find places that will let you rent out the unit though.

2. Buy my forever home in a desirable suburb now, live in it a year or two and rent it out. Then go rent in Chicago (if I get bored or don't like it, I can move and rent whatever city I want). Meanwhile, the mortgages are being paid off earning equity.

I just want to get some different opinions, pitfalls, things to look out for/consider. 

Thanks!"
2958,realestateinvesting,Potential pitfalls of rural landlording,"Hi folks!

What are your experiences with being a landlord in rural areas / areas with scarce population?

I live in Europe and I'm looking to buy my first rental unit. There is a rural county about 90 minutes drive away with cheap property. The county has about 50.000 inhabitants in total and the two biggest cities are not bigger than 15.000 and 10.000 people respectively. There are factories and companies around, but mostly the area is agricultural. Its about 2 hours drive to the closest big city (1 million+) and due to new train stations and highway it will soon be about 90 minutes away from another big city. 

The property prices are low, about half of what it would cost to build a new house. The banks refuse to mortgage these properties, which makes the prices even lower.

Apart from all this, many of the properties in the area have great numbers. One property is being sold fully occupied for €95.000 with a gross rent of €1450 per month. Another for €80.000 with a gross rent of €1150.

I can secure 100% financing with my own house as collateral with about 4% interest rate.

What are some potential pitfalls and problems with properties in scarcely populated areas?"

2963,realestateinvesting,Structuring a joint venture deal with big developer (we own the land),"My family has been approached by a big CRE investment/capital group of recently built apartment buildings (+400 units) near the land we are discussing here. We do not intend to sell and instead would rather enter into a joint venture deal where we contribute the land, act like silent partners in the operations, and get equity as the other party focuses on the development side of things. We will be meeting soon to talk specifics and would like to extend this thread to anyone who has had experience in similar deals or has any valuable insights into how this deal can be structured, particularly the equity percentage.

Details about the land:

About one acre in an Urban Village in Fort Worth, Texas. The land is a corner lot in a growing area (lots of new developments, mainly apartments with updates to existing commercial buildings). Area is currently being gentrified with a lot of homeless populations but is slowly being dwindled down. For reference, more than 1,000 units have been built in the past 3-5 years within a half mile radius. The city is actively supporting the development of this urban village with between $1M-$2M in road improvements in 2018 i believe. Since softly marketing it (sign on the land), we have had several big players in the CRE industry contact us, the apartment company who recently contacted us is the biggest interest so far. The corner lot is on a heavily trafficked cross street and the urban village is very close to downtown fort worth. As far as the zoning goes, we are able to build a three-story building with retail on the bottom and residential above, and the apartment company seems to be going in this direction. 

Problems we initially see is going to be the parking with the size of the land, but aside from any specifics about the deal and how they would be compensated to each side, what are some typical deal structures seen for this type of deal? (side question: When would be a good time to hire a real estate lawyer, before or during talks with them?)"

2969,realestateinvesting,"Question about purchasing with seller financing, then refi in the future","Hey guys looking for some advice. This would be our first investment property. Purchase would be for a property with a manufactured home and additional land that adjoins. This is a popular destination a few hours away from our current residence, where we plan on moving eventually when we can make life work. Our intent is to purchase and STR to cover mortgage while visiting a few times a year, or LTR if we had to. We can cover a mortgage on it currently with no additional income, it’d just be nice to not have to.  In a few years we would move out and there and build something for a long term home at that point.

We’re going to look at it this weekend, and I’d just like to know what I’m getting into beforehand. I’ve done some reading but I’d appreciate any advice.

Listing says owner financing available. We’d prefer to go the traditional route, have the money and the credit score. In some of the pictures though it appears there is no shower facility, it’s a 1.5 bath and the only tub appears to have been removed. This precludes a traditional mortgage correct, because it’s not immediately habitable? Also does not have a stove, according to pictures


So if we cannot obtain traditional financing, we can go the route of owner financing, fix these plus some other issues, then refi down the road, correct?

How long do we have to wait to refi? I’ve seen 12 months of on-time payments minimum listed in some places, is this accurate?

It seems these are usually structured as a 3 or 5 year agreement with a balloon payment after that. Does that seem right? We would like to get on a 30 year as soon as possible so it shouldn’t matter

I believe the property is undervalued due to a couple of issues my wife and I are uniquely qualified to handle, but who knows what the next year holds. When we go to refi, what if the property appraises for less than the seller carried note? What if it appraises for way more?

Any advice on other things to look out for?"

2973,realestateinvesting,Does high ROI make up for lower cap rate?,"My wife and I are thinking of getting into RE investing. Mostly by purchasing a new SFH for ourselves and renting out our current home. We’d be renting a 3 bed 1 bath SFH.


I ran the numbers and it seems like our ROI would be around 22% while cap rate is around 2.1%. I also did my math including the mortgage in the expenses, as every website had a slightly different variation on equation and this made sense to me. Also if I use the same calculations on nearby properties they all were around the 2-3% cap rate, so it’s inline with the average.


If it helps it’s basically $2550/month expenses including 1% of value saved for emergency stuff. But roof, windows and heat were replaced in the last 5 years. 
The rent would be around $3300/month. 



Also this may sound stupid, but even if it’s not 100% optimal we just like this house and have like a 2.2% interest rate. It’s increased 15% in value since we bought it and we expect to continue to increase in the long run since it’s in a nice part of an up and coming neighborhood. We aren’t worried about a ton of cash flow, at least in the short term. We just don’t want to end up making a bad decision. 


On the above note, our next house were making sure it’s affordable even if we don’t rent this one. Rent would just be to help cover the costs, but it wouldn’t cripple us if it’s vacant. 


Anyway long story short: is this low cap rate (even though it’s average) raise a giant red flag? The ROI looks good and even seems like it could cash flow. 


Is renting a SFH worth it at these numbers?"

So I informed the current property manager that I will terminate our agreement at the end of the term. I gave her plenty of days notice as agreed upon in the contract. However, she is adamant that she has the right to renew the lease with the tenant before we transition to the new property manager. I do not understand why she thinks she can renew a contract that she will not oversee. Moreover, we have nothing in writing stating that I have to renew with her. She is likely trying to push to get one last fee from me.

What is the best way to handle her? I am worried that she will try and keep me from getting my rent money at the end of the term. Can I ask the tenant to directly pay me? Does she have any credibility in her stance?"

I know eggshell is the general recommendation for a primary residence, but I've seen two main schools of thought for rentals.

Satin/Semi-Gloss - These are more durable/washable. Just give a quick wash in between tenants


High Quality Matte - High quality mattes have some washability, but the real benefit is touch ups are easy. Touch ups can be done very quickly in between tenants, since you don't need to repaint the whole wall.

The vast majority of my money is in stocks/equities (instead of cash), and I believe these investments will continue to appreciate as the year goes on. The plan is to sell some to use a portion of these funds for my down payment when the time comes. I believe they will continue to appreciate as the year goes on, so do not want to sell until the last minute.

I was wondering, when lending institutions are reviewing your finances, do they care if your assets are in stocks vs cash? Ie would it look bad if my cash balance when applying for prequalification would only be a 4-5x monthly expense emergency fund, or would they realize I have notable $$ and unrealized capital gains in stocks and not care?

2990,realestateinvesting,Poke holes in the deal I'm offering,"&gt; 2650 sqft house
&gt; 4/2.5/3 
&gt; 350sqft garage apartment with 1/1. No kitchenette.
&gt; Pool and nice covered deck.
&gt; Roof and HVAC are 1.5 years old.
 &gt;Foundation looks solid.
 &gt; Pool equipment well maintained, minus a busted gasket the owner is having replaced.
&gt; Downstairs flooring and tile thought in great shape (minus wood entry that needs refinish, and carpet in master).

The kicker: owner wants to lease back for a year, and will pay $3500/month (can pay monthly, lump sum at closing, or reduce sales price by $42k).

Offering is structured to take the $42k off price.

Offering terms:
$305k as-is

Buyer cover closing costs, minus taxes/HOA (approximately $25k)

Cash to close $330k

Repairs: $60k (complete interior primer and paint, master bath reno, repaint cabinets throughout, new carpet in main house, and maybe new counters for kitchen, granite already there, but for sure dated). Interior was in way better shape than I was thinking it's be in, and $60k is, imo a very high number. 

ARV: $480k conservatively. My market has not seen a drastic shift downward in prices and is one of the more affordable markets in the US for a major metro.

Neighborhood is massive and has been getting built out slowly since the late 80s. Mix of resale and new construction. More resales sold in last 6 months vs new build. Fewer resale offered for sale vs new build currently (somewhat irrelevant since lease would be in place for 1 year). 

New build $200/sqft for comps (sqft range 2250-3050).

Updated resale $170/sqft without pool. Not enough data to reliable state what $/sqft is *with* a pool.

I know the leaseback potion is mf-er. I'm trying to work around this by finding a place that will accept the owner, but he has 3 dogs, 1 weighing 100+ pounds and the other a pitbull. The guy has awesome credit and is flush, would be a good tenant and has even offered to pay for the make ready when he leaves (and is open to covering labor costs if an investor is providing materials, which could help reduce repair estimate).

My husband and I live in NYC where the market has been insane (both in the city and suburbs) for years since COVID. Since we have sort of given up finding a home that’s worth it’s price for the next few years, we bit the bullet last year and bought a 2br/2ba condo in Virginia for a super reasonable price. I was the only person on that mortgage application - my husband wasn’t involved financially. We rent it and make a great ROI on that property. We always said if another unit comes up in that complex when we have the money, we’d go for it again.

A few units were posted yesterday that were interested in buying. I’m now looking at applying for a second mortgage. I remember seeing somewhere that it makes sense to stagger the mortgages - meaning, I was the owner of the first mortgage, my husband should own the second, I own the third, etc. rather than applying for the mortgage together as a couple.

More than the small amount of cash flow I might eke out after PITI, the idea of running cost seg tables to maximize the depreciation, and then be able to offset my w2 income against it to reduce my taxes is much more alluring.


Ive been thinking about willingly overpaying for a high quality property (A+ location, new construction, etc), being ok covering any shortfall between the rental revenue and expenses, just to get that depreciation offsetting my income.

I’d just hold long term and 1031 it to deal with the cost recovery recapture tax.

Anyone ever formulated a strategy like this? Just trying to think it through."

3027,realestateinvesting,Short Term Rental and Depreciation Question,"Hello,

Im considering investing in STR if the market cools down over the next year. Mainly looking to diversify portfolio but also get a piece of property we can enjoy.

My plan would be to buy and hold a house in the $1.5M range for 10-15 years. I would rent out most of the year with a property management company but would use the house more than 14 days per year, maybe like 30 days total. This is the sticking point with my spouse. If we limit use to 14 days, they are not interested.  Because of our use &gt;14 days, we would not be able to claim a rental loss on paper.

So my question is if I am considering the following tax implications correctly. I would anticipate negative cash flows or close to breaking even for the first couple of years. Anticipated income would be \~$120k with operating expenses of \~$55k so net operating income would hopefully be around $65k. Depreciation for the building would likely be \~$35K. Other deductions would include $5K for insurance, $5k for property tax, $18k for property management, $4K utilities. So we could be looking at a small loss on paper but I doesn't look like it would be huge.

So if we don't achieve a loss on paper (or its fairly small), then it wont matter whether we stayed at the house for more than 14 days per year and we dont need to argue about this. My main concern would be missing out on major losses from depreciation deductions each year and then having a huge depreciation recapture bill when I sell. Am I thinking about this correctly? Appreciate any insight."

3040,realestateinvesting,Need an Idiot Check. Am I looking at this situation wrong?,"Hi folks - I am thinking about making the leap to buying my first property in the next 90 to 120 days and wanted to run my general plan by this thread to see what people think. I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/ztjjrk/what_advise_would_you_give_yourself_if_you/) thread and thought it had a lot of cool advice so figured I would post. I do plan to do a lot more specific research before I dive in, so just looking for an idiot check here. 

My friend and I are thinking about making the leap together to buying our first few properties. For some background on us: we are both 28 years old and live in Boston, MA. He works for a big tech company as a successful software engineer, I am a commercial real estate  attorney for a large law firm. I doubt my attorney experience will be very relevant for this as I mostly deal with $100MM+ properties and it's a totally different beast. 

We have been planning to buy an investment property together in the area for some time. Our plan was to try and buy a property here in MA, maybe in Worcester, but the entry points for all the properties within a 3 hour drive from me are very very high and as far as I can tell the properties around here don't really cash flow. 

So we have started to think about investing out of state. Trolling around here and the BP forums, it looks like there's a lot of support for the midwestern cities, particularly Columbus, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Cleveland (and then also OKC and KC, though those are less appealing to me because the areas are less familiar). But, a lot of the people on BP at least harping the virtues of these cities are also agents in those cities, so it's hard to tell if it's really a great market or something else. 

Columbus is particularly appealing to us because it looks like properties there cash flow decently well but also have a good chance of appreciation with the Intel plant coming in, and OSU constantly churning through 50k students. We also have a mutual friend who lives in Columbus and we think we could rope him in for a moderate fee ($150 an hour?) to do some basic pop-ins on contractors, a quick walkthrough of a property before sale, probably not much more. We like that the population seems to be growing well too, which doesn't look to be the case for Cincy or Cleveland. Indianapolis is probably second place, with a lower entry point (but perhaps less potential for growth). 

Our hope is to try and buy a SFH or duplex at about $80K-$120K, hopefully with conventional financing  at 20-25% down, use cash to do a light to medium rehab (hoping something around the $30K range tops, not sure if that is realistic AT ALL -- it would not be here in MA). The goal is an all in cost of maybe 50-60K of our cash for a property that has a cash flow around $500/mo. 

Does this seem like a crazy idea? 

A few final notes:

* I cannot house hack, I own my house and my wife is not going to be pleased if I tell her we are moving out of the house she loves that's 10 mins from her parents, into a cheap duplex. 
* I want to go in with my partner to help cut down on the risk. We are going to put together a decent JV Agreement (now this, my background is helpful for). Not sure yet what we are going to do to split investments. Part of me wants to go 50/50 to avoid drama down the line, part of me wants to do a waterfall so if the property nets more of a return than expected I profit since I will be doing a lot more work. If we go 50/50 though I think that would be fine realistically - I can use this as learning experience and branch out on my own later. 
* I don't want to lose money, but my wife and I together earn maybe $450k per year, and my partner and his fiancée earn a bit more so I can stomach a bit of risk. 
* I don't want to wait too long to start because, quite frankly, I will probably start having kids within the next 2 years or so and it's going to be harder to divert money to real estate investing once I have to pay for kids. This is one of the primary reasons I don't think that I should wait to do a property locally. I think I could pull off 1 property before I had kids at $400K purchase price, but probably not more than that. 
* If anyone is local to New England and has ideas on local areas that are a low entry point (and have a decent enough population) I would love to hear about them. I've looked at Fall River, New Bedford, Worcester, Fitchburg, Lowell, Providence, Springfield (and surrounding towns) and Hartford. The towns East/South of 495 don't seem to have much inventory below \~400K, and I would be very wary of investing in Springfield because it's been stagnating for years (and, there are no ""nice"" parts of Springfield, they aren't going to gentrify in the near future).
* My instinct is to try to BRRR if possible, since I'd like to reinvest my money as I go along, but I am also interested in turnkey opportunities (either in the sense of a true turnkey company, or in the sense of buying a rehabbed property and installing my own PM and tenants).
* Does anyone have any advice on getting a conventional loan (or something similar) with an LLC, backed by personal guaranties from me and my partner? I am fine holding the liability for the loan, but would not own real property outside of a special purpose Delaware LLC both because of the possibility of non-loan related liability, and also because it makes it harder to have a properly papered partnership agreement with my partner -- I don't want there to be a tenants-in-common situation. I'm fine paying a slightly higher rate for this, but with rates already pretty high I don't want some crazy commercial loan if I can avoid it. Some people say they take title to the property in their name, and then QCD it to an LLC in the hope that the lender wont exercise its due on sale clause, but I wouldn't do that unless the lender agreed in writing to waive the due on sale clause for a permitted transfer. This might be a small point in the grand scheme of things, and it might just be the CRE attorney in me speaking, but generally holding title in an SPE is one of the only non-negotiables for me. 
* I've heard of some PMs who are willing to take on the rehab work for properties (at a nice markup on their contractors rates, of course). Has anyone heard of this? Does this make sense? It's OK if it eats into my returns a bit if it reduces the general risk of investing out of state. 
* Finally, I don't need this to be super profitable right this instant. I have my job and my partner has his job and those will do for us for now. I am looking for something that shows enough return that it is a good proof of concept, and then otherwise to build something that will last me through the years.

That's all I can think of... Anyone have any tips? Appreciate both specific analysis and general advice."

Conservatively, in current market conditions, I’d expect 70% occupancy over the 16 weeks of summer, and 25% during fall/winter/spring. This is based on other lake front luxury STRs within 10 miles. 

Property includes $800k building lot (current market value, mind you…), Income generating apartment, large barn with event space and offices which could potentially generate revenue. So there are a few built in insurances if SHTF.

3058,realestateinvesting,ChatGPT's Real Estate investing advice,"I asked ChatGPT to tell me how to identify a good RE investment property, here's what it had to say: 

 

""When considering whether a real estate property is a good investment, there are several factors to take into account.

First, it's important to consider the location of the property. Properties in desirable areas with strong job markets and good schools tend to appreciate in value over time and attract steady tenants. Look for properties that are close to transportation, amenities, and services, as these can also make the property more attractive to renters.

Next, you should consider the condition of the property and the cost of any repairs or renovations that may be needed. Be sure to factor in these costs when calculating the property's potential return on investment.

You should also research the local real estate market and trends, including the average rental rates and vacancy rates. This will give you an idea of the property's potential rental income and the demand for rental properties in the area.

You should also look at the current landlord or the previous one, and see if they have a history of taking care of the property. Also you should check if the property is currently vacant or not, how long it has been vacant, if it has a history of high turnover and if there is any reason why the property is vacant.

Finally, consider the property's financials, including the purchase price, financing terms, and projected expenses and revenue. Look for properties with positive cash flow, as these will generate income from rent and can help offset the costs of holding the property.

Keep in mind that being a landlord has its own set of expenses and responsibilities which you should account for as well.

Overall, a good real estate investment property is one that is located in a desirable area, is in good condition and has the potential for positive cash flow. You will have to do your due diligence and research the property, the area, and the local real estate market to make an informed decision.""

3081,realestateinvesting,Section 8 question,"so I found a property out of state that even with the high interest rates kind of makes sense. Everything else just isn’t at that 12% cash on cash return. But section 8 pays for that county 1400 bucks a month where is market rent is 1000-1200. and while not at my number it is the highest I’ve seen and is still an above 1% rental.

My question is I’ve never worked with section 8 before and I don’t know how that goes with the amount that you are approved for based off of bedrooms. 


Does section 8 just approve you for that amount and then the section 8 person has a component of that which they bring to the table or is that the max you can be approved for and homes depending on the section 8 inspection will be more or less then the $1400 a month stated for this county for a 3 bed

B. I am not Mexican. I know beachfronts are allowed to foreigners only via Trusts. I am ok ok with it. 
C. I am well off. Losing a property wont hurt me much.
D. I have experience in managing far away rentals, in usa and India.

The question: I recently visited the area. Found many nice highrises with secluded beaches and killer views. 

Many of these properties had a property manager who also manages these as airbnb too, for a small fee. Hoa covers everything thing(300usd covers electric/water/pool/maintenance). Annual tax is practically a rounding error.

I strongly believe border cities are getting gentrified and will improve way more in upcoming decade as Mexico is positioned to get boost from tradewars. I think it will be a good bet.

The cash flow projections seems to very good, even if I factor in Peso getting devalued to 20%.

Has any one here purchased investment property in TJ or Rosarito? What am I missing here?

- it is in an up and coming neighborhood near bed stuy 
- each unit is 3 bed/1 bath
- it is on a main road  , but street noise cannot be heard outside 
- has a backyard
- washer and dryer hookup in each unit
- will be delivered vacant 
- old termite damage affecting structure in cellar, quotes from contractors on my end were 40-70k but seller says he has a contractor for 9k to repair after purchase 
- house next door is a shell and leaning on this house, slowly creating new structural damage 
- house needs mold remediation
- full gut of one of the bathrooms is required 
- kitchen and bathrooms in all units need updating 
- roof is like new 
- boiler, water heater etc good
- additional smaller repairs needed (painting etc)
- mortgage would be 6500/month
- no basement, cellar only 
- house 3 blocks away on a quiet tree lined street just sold for 1.1 (it also has a full finished basement but is railroad style bedrooms and needs full Reno)
- it is almost impossible to find a 3 fam house in NYC for less than  1.3

Do you feel this is standard for a second lender to require the first lenders estimate? Would you expect to have to share a final estimate when getting a second opinion estimate?

I have a unit that I need to refinance. We originally took a bridge loan for the down payment of our new house so we didn't have to have any selling contingencies for our old place. We listed our old place for a while and didn't love the offers we received so we've decided to furnish the unit and rent to nurses and oil/gas people who work on 3-6 month contracts. We've already got our first renter ready to move in.   


The bridge loan will come up in August and we'd like to continue renting for the time being as we think current rates are scaring off some buyers (or we're just not realistic in our selling price). Wanted to get any advice for refinancing as this will be our first time refinancing. Our bridge loan is for $336k and lets assume our equity is already \~25% (not sure where it will appraise but we're close to that mark and have the cash to make up the difference if needed). 

Do you prefer an online lender? Work with someone local (we've had issues trying to get an investment loan with a local bank because ""they don't really do that"")?

3120,realestateinvesting,Quit or see it through? First major rehab attempt,"I bought a small 1200sq ft house in the South for next to nothing, but... to some degree you get what you pay for. This job has ended up being a full gut job due to the state of the house.

* Layers and layers of cheap paneling was taken out
* Old suspect electrical work was all removed
* Old leaky PVC and supply lines were all taken out, and I put in new drain pipe all the way to the sewer main and got 1"" pex now running to inside the crawlspace (no other plumbing done yet)
* Due to water and termite damage, I tore out the entire subfloor floor, and I put in all new floor joists and in some areas, entirely new rim joists.
* It was sitting on cinder blocks with so I poured a footer and bricked it up the rim joists
* The crawl space was too shallow so I've dug almost all of it down to 20"" or so. 

And that's pretty much where I'm at now. This work was all done DIY -- I started this way back during the pandemic and contractors were almost completely unavailable in my rural area -- and even though I've really only slowly accomplished demo and structural work, I am pretty proud of what I've learned aboust construction - espcially masonry and carpentry - considering I had never tackled something this major before. 

But...

The major foundation and brick work especially took an eternity doing by myself and I feel like this is honestly becoming more of a money pit quixiotic hobby, than a legitimate investment opportunity and I wonder if I'm now not just somewhat attached to the house for the wrong reasons.

The other problems to consider is that my day job sometimes takes me far away, and several times I've had to deal with break ins and theft of tools, materials, etc. when I've been away. At this point I feel like I have 4 options. 

1. **DIY that impossible dream**. Just accept that I kind of want to finish it for the learning aspects / personal interest value of the whole thing and stop worry about the money. I do feel like with the foundation stuff done, the worst part is behind me.
2. **Bring in a GC to finish it off.** Suck it up and pay a ton of money to finish it off, maybe breaking even-ish, but on the plus side a finished property will be much easier to rent/sell etc.
3. **Be my own GC**. Get a carpenter to finish the framing, plumber, electrictian etc. Take a little more time and be more involved. At least something of an educational experience and maybe even see a little profit. 
4. **Get rid of it**. Cut the emotional cord, admit I bit off more than I can chew, sell it to another investor to hopefully get a little money back, and just get on with my life. This may actually be the best economic choice because I do quite well in my day job, and focusing more of my time on that would probably make me the most money at the end of the day. This is also...  kind of the least appealing option.

Any thoughts? Anybody else been in a similar situation? All input is appreciated."
3121,realestateinvesting,New California Laws that allows multifamily housing to be built on commercially zoned properties without permitting. Questions. (SB6 &amp; AB 2011),"Hello all, just wanted to know if someone had a better understanding of these laws than me and if they would like to share.

AFAIK, these would allow you to build multifamily housing on commercial properties without CUPs, (from the local municipalities?) under some conditions. The two major ones I know of are:

1: You must build at least 30% of them be affordable housing or 15% be low income housing. 2: You must pay the construction workers a certain wage.

There are other conditions in the law, usually you have to build a certain amount of parking space per unit, but you don't need to meet that requirement if you're within .5 of a mile from a ""major transit stop"". And your development can't be within 500 feet from a freeway.

Do you know if this applies to all types of commercial property? I assume it won't for industrial. I believe it definitely will for retail, office, and... parking?

I have a few owners that have have like, rundown auto body shops and storage, etc. I'm wondering what information would be valuable to share with them. The law would go into effect in July. Do you think this will affect the value of properties that can take advantage of these laws?

The thing is I can’t stop finding things wrong with the house to upgrade, like for example everything looks very nice but one of the bathrooms is way less good looking than the rest of the house. To the point where I don’t know if I should leave it since it’s a rental or sink 15k into making it way nicer to fit the rest of the house to get a higher rent.

In conjunction, I'm $1600 CAD in negative cash flow per month. If I dump all of $550k strategically between these five properties and lock some of the mortgages to a 2-year fixed mortgage at current rates, I would break even. Additionally, the rent payments I'm getting start servicing some principal again and not just interest only.

But instead, people are saying it is okay to be in negative cash flow and suggesting to not lock the cash in properties. Instead dump the cash into high paying dividend stocks or riets. This doesn't sound like a wise decision to me but maybe I'm missing something?"

3158,realestateinvesting,Question about my Unique Situation regarding buying a property with my mom and brother but Now i want out of the deal. The property is in a 1031 exchange (my mom). So here is the story: We all lived together in Property A (which my mom owned). She had Property B rented out. (continued below),"My Mom decides to Sell Property B and give the net proceeds (about 600k) to my brother and I to buy Property C.  Property A gets converted to rental

Me, my brother, and my mom WERE all on the deed. For Property C, Just my brother and I are on the loan. My mom makes property C as a 1030 exchange on order to avoid taxes from Selling Property B. Due to this, my brother and I signed the deed over to my mom so she could save on taxes and so it can be her 1031 exchange. 

It gets a little complicated since we all used to live together in property C. Now I moved out and want to buy another property (property D). What my mom wants to do is:  Sell Property C (net will be 1 million). She wants to give 500k to me as a downpayment and use the other 500k to pay off the remaining amount on Property A. Is this even possible with 1031 exchange? What are some implications tax wise, deed wise etc?

Context: My partner and I (25/27) bought a condo at the beach during the pandemic in February of 2021. It was our first property, we put like 15% down and scored it for $380,000. We have a 3.125 interest rate and since then, we if it appraised for over 550000 after some minor renovations and the housing boom. Got PMI removed, lowered our home insurance, etc so it’s honestly about as cheap of debt as we can get. We both do well for ourselves and never assumed the beach would be where we would settle and consider it almost an impulse purchase that happened to do really well. 

Our goal is to purchase a similar property in the Denver area in the next few months. We have the cash to do it , but would prefer to be able to somehow pull out some the equity we were blessed with without losing our great interest rate to hold onto some of our savings. 

Do any other avenues exist besides refinancing to a higher interest rate or a heloc? Want to make sure we aren’t missing anything.

3168,realestateinvesting,"What happened in Atlanta, GA last year? Notable increase in investor RE purchases... Why?","According to a few news article and some of the RE data itself... At various points in 2021(q4)/2022, roughly 1 in 3 (later 1 in 4) of the home purchases were real estate investors. That is a pretty decent jump in ratio - historically no more than roughly 1 in 8 is the typical trend based on what I could find.

What is attracting so much attention to this area? 

I've been through a few articles - and they just point to the purchase ratio (mostly headline click-bait) but don't really provide any context as to the ""why"". I'm not from that area, but I've combed through some of the basic numbers and I don't see anything glaring (particularly compared to other cities). No notable substantial increase in foreclosures, no huge surplus in supply, etc. I couldn't find any indications its a specific large company (or even a few) that was specifically focusing on this area.

I was hoping to learn from people that actively invest in that area. What are you seeing? What is the cause for this surge? Is there some data I'm missing? Some of the articles point to the low inventory... but that is nationwide. Some articles point to the job growth - but unemployment is at an amazing low right now across the nation (despite other macro financial conditions). Some of the property research - it looks like RE is still affordable, but its also affordable in other areas that aren't attracting so much attention. What is unique about Atlanta, GA?

3170,realestateinvesting,"Advice On My Unique Investing Situation After Mother, Grandmother, And Father Died In Last 1.5 Years"," So I'm considering buying my deceased grandmothers house from my Aunt. Right now the property is estimated to be worth between $350-$400k. I'm inheriting 1/3rd of the sale price as per my grandmothers will. It's a 2 unit multi family home in Chicago. The basement is essentially a skeleton ready to be converted into a 3rd unit. It has a finished bedroom, a bathroom, plumbing to add a kitchen, and a storage room that could potentially be converted into a second bedroom. I know contractors, and carpenters through friends and family so can get good deals making repairs etc.

So my question is after watching BPP talk about "" 2023 Housing Market: It’ll Get Worse Before It Gets Better"" in a recent video, and Graham Stephan saying ""Don’t Buy A Home In 2023 (The Worst Drop On Record)"" in a recent video should I try to pull the trigger before this supposed drop happens, or will the drop not be significant enough to severely lessen the amount of money I'm inheriting from buying house from aunt to use the money towards repairs/increasing equity?

To note I will be renting the house I already own with its mortgage paid off either entirely, or through house hacking while still living there

If you'd like to lay out a simple outline how you might take advantage of this situation it would also be appreciated. If you need more details please DM me if you'd like. I'm thinking about holding for a few years at least renting, and potentially doing a 1031 exchange with it to get a better property, in a better location"

The house hasn't been updated in 30 years.  They did make some changes such as putting up a flimsy wall to subdivide a bedroom and carve out the garage to make it into a 1-bedroom, but as far as I can tell, they've made no other changes since it was built 30 years ago.

This is on MLS so I have to channel all discussions via agents.  The sellers asked way over the market, and I let it sit without an offer for a month before making mine.  My offer was around 60% of their asking price, but I think it's the correct price given the needed updates and potential ARV.  

The sellers came back and they want me to pay $50K more.  I'm thinking I'll counter by asking them to pay for any structural repairs, such as water or termite damage that's above $1000.  Also, do the same for the septic system. I don't want them to actually make the repairs, but I want them to see the risks I'm taking. Any other suggestions?"

I would find the recent ones, look up when the property was bought, how much is owed on it, etc. I would look up the comps.

1)I am wondering how to convince them to sell for an all cash offer. I have thoughts on this, but would love to hear more.

2)The worst part. How to get them to just TALK? 

I would say hi, how are you; they would answer, and I would say my name is X, here is my girlfriend (I took her with me to look less intimidating and made people feel more comfortable), and I would like to buy your house. 

1 person just immediately said “No”, with a look on her face “I have heard this offer many times”. She was very polite, but clearly the conversation reached dead end. The second person said “I am not selling my house” and slammed the door.

I am totally okay with rejection, even with 99 rejections in 100. I am just wondering if this reaction is inevitable in most cases, or if I can start off in a better way?

And while I have decent interest rates on them, the rent at 1400 even with money (10%) put aside for replacement stuff every year I only net about a grand from them because there’s always stuff that comes up that’s more expensive than my maintenance fund.


I would like to scale, but the issue is that my entire county the multi family homes in my city are more expensive than the FHA limits and wouldn’t even come close to cash flowing as the quad Plex are over $1 million and rent for maybe $2000 each Maybe and the multi family‘s in the rest of my county and surrounding counties are all in really bad neighborhoods. I was about to pull the trigger just before Covid hit on one and it blew up and now that home is way too expensive.

I don’t mind doing the house hack with roommates, but that’s not scalable the rest of my life.

3216,realestateinvesting,Considering real estate investment,"Hello,

I'm considering getting into real estate investment at some point this year.

My motivation is that my wife and I work in 'recession resistant' companies/industries and our company equity is up in the current market.  I think this could be a good time for us to diversify and look at opportunistically investing in other markets that are down and the first thing that comes to mind for me is real estate.

The case is that we could sell up to about $500k in our different company stocks next year to invest.

My idea is that we would invest that money in rental properties. My primary goal if I did this would be to have an investment here that could run and grow without regularly needing additional capital, though I appreciate there is risk that could change that. My secondary goal is to be able to manage this part time (&lt;5-10 hours a week on average).

Is entering real estate in 2023 under these circumstances a good idea to the people who know what they're doing?

&amp;#x200B;

The questions that occur to me immediately are:

1) What is considered an appropriate amount of debt with 500k starting equity and my above goals?

2) What is an ideal distribution of the number/cost of properties that I would want to consider? I like the idea of more expensive properties but I don't like the idea of losing half of my income because 1 of my properties is vacant.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there are a lot of other considerations I'm not even thinking about here and I'm open to hearing anything as feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

Other details that might be relevant--I'm based in the US and I live in Massachusetts. I have very strong credit and I own a single family home that we occupy as our primary residence. Happy to share anything else that might be helpful."

3218,realestateinvesting,"Creative Financing with the ""Morby"" method","There's a guy named Pace Morby telling people a way to buy houses all cash. 

This is the gist:

* Get a Seller to take the cash offer while you use a DSCR loan and a private money lender.
* Allow the DSCR lender to see you have the other funds to close
* Get everything moving, close escrow. Now you have a timeline to pay the private money lender back.
* From the second escrow after you already have the deed, get the money to pay the private lender off to go away now.
* Now you are essentially left with a DSCR fixed rate loan and a seller financed portion for whatever terms you agreed to and now the house is ""yours"".

This sounds fine and dandy, but at the end of the day you just basically ended up with 2 loans and if the gross income doesn't pay off those loans and all the extras, then it's a waste of time right?

Also, this is a benefit to the seller because they get the cash upfront and then make another profit off the cash they lent, but personally I've never met regular home owners that want to deal or care about that, even with the enticement of money.

Lastly, couldn't you just get a private lender for the money down in the first place, then pay them back over a certain amount of time with cash flow?

I feel this only works with cheap multi-families with high rents.

Feel free to share thoughts and comments! Thank you!"
3219,realestateinvesting,Is there a financially advantageous use of a HELOC?,"I own 6 properties, all but one financed as investment properties with at least 30% equity in each of them. I have adequate cash reserves to address any issues that may arise and even to acquire additional properties though I am waiting for the economic climate to settle more before doing so which may be 2 or so years. 

It seems using a HELOC might make sense for renovations in the case where one either has insufficient cash on hand or could get a higher return on the capital than the interest on the loan.  

Are there other scenarios where using a HELOC is advantageous?"

It needs very minimal work. Probably about 20k. A wholesaler that I work with also sent me the property as a wholesaler at 230k. Assuming they make an aggressive cash offer, the owner had to accept something like 220 for him to barely make anything.  This is wholesase and there's no broker's so it's not like he makes another commission on top of that. I buy cash and then refi later so it's not like he's getting a referral fee.

3225,realestateinvesting,How to get to the next level with my real estate income?,"I’m fairly early in my real estate career and for the last few years I’ve gotten to the point where I am consistently making around $6.5-9k a month. I have a pretty decent life, but I’m curious how I can get my income to the next level. I want to be making $10k, $15k, $20k per month consistently.

A little background on how I got to this point in my life so far:

When I was 23, I used all my savings to buy a four unit property with an FHA loan. I’ve been able to successfully house-hack that ever since, living for free while making about $1.5k a month from this. Additionally, I currently work as a project manager for a large developer making about $120k per year. Finally, I have a few side hustles (property management, handyman, etc.) and I’m able to make $2-4k a month from this. I keep my expenses really low - only about $1.5k a month (food, gas, random things here and there - nothing crazy). So this leaves me left with about $6.5-9k a month. Sometimes I’ll hit a month where I make $10k or more. I currently have $100k cash saved up.

I don’t see myself being able to scale my side hustles anymore than they are now, and I don’t want to leave my day job yet because the real estate knowledge I’m getting there is invaluable. I plan on starting my own development company one day. But in the meantime, what would you suggest to go from where I’m at now, to making $10k, $15k, $20k a month consistently, ideally within the next 6 months?"

I've read that it's best to do an offer for the property based on the average unit sales in the area for the base offer and then during the due diligence you negotiate down based on the NOI figures and cap rate. Is this strategy the best approach? 
I'm a little worried that the unit sales in the area might be a lot higher then what the actual cash flow of the property supports. Its owned by an 85 year old lady with no suriving direct family and is managed by a property manager that I couldn't find any info about besides four other apartments she manages for small time out of state investors. I'm guessing the apartment is behind on maintenance and behind on market rents. If I have my base offer high and I try to negotiate down at a later date I feel like she might be insulted or assume I'm trying to take advantage of her situation, which I'm hoping we can strike a deal that is beneficial for both of us.

By this response I am a bit confused if this means I should still apply and have a chance to move in Feb 1? I'm not sure how many other applicants would be ready to move ASAP, especially since this is January and I would guess it'd be hard for most people to move with such short notice right after the holidays.

3257,realestateinvesting,"For those that adjust rent for certain amenities, by how much do you adjust each for?","Example

Inherited tenant currently at $550. They pay utilities, about $100/mo. 

Fair Market Rent\* (FMR) minus utilities is about $650. So, without adjustments, they are about $100 under FMR. 

Amenities 

* 1.5 car garage = +$50 (cost of nearby garage self-storage through app)
* off street parking spot = +$20 (snow removal)
* washer/dryer (not coin operated) = +$5 or zero
* forced air (not considered, although there is a difference between comps with and without)

Most comps have around the same rents, but they do not have garages and most only have washer/dryer hookups (not the actual appliances). Most of the newly renovated units have garages and washer/dryer. 

I'm not asking what this tenant's rent should be. I'm asking, for those who analytically adjust rent for newly acquired SFHs and MFHs, what values do you put for certain amenities.

\*

&gt; ^(Fair Market Rent is generally calculated as the 40th percentile of gross  rents for regular, standard quality units in a local housing market.  This excludes low-quality units, already subsidized units, and units  that have been built in the last 2 years. FMR rent data is typically  taken from recent move ins rather than long-term tenants, as long-term  tenants generally receive a lower monthly rental rate. FMR includes core  utilities, like water and power, but doesn’t include internet and other  optional services.)     
&gt;  
&gt;^(In order to calculate Fair Market Rents, HUD utilizes several different  sets of data, including gross rents data from the U.S. Census Bureau,  gross rent information from HUD’s American Housing Survey, as well as  additional rental rate data gleaned from yearly telephone surveys.)

&gt; ^(Typical, non-substandard rental units: In developing the FMR, the  following units are excluded: public housing units, rental units built  in the last 2 years, rental units considered substandard in quality,  seasonal rentals, and rental units on 10 or more acres. The definition  excludes public housing units to prevent subsidized rents from skewing  the distribution. Similarly, rental units built in the last 2 years are  excluded to eliminate units at the higher end of the market from the  distribution. Since Section 8 seeks to improve the quality of housing  occupied by lower-income families, substandard units are eliminated from  the distribution. Finally, seasonal units and units on large plots are  not part of the market intended for Section 8 recipients.)

3286,realestateinvesting,Question on rental housing (going to be a student at Boston university dental school) what should I do,"Hello, I am a incoming D1 at BU Dental School and am wondering what I would do for housing. I am interested in investing in real-estate once I graduate dental school and was wondering what you think of buying a 4 bedroom condo in Boston. I was thinking I would be able to rent the other rooms to fellow students to supplement the mortgage. 

The idea of spending 100k on rent over 4 years and have no equity seems dumb to me but then at the same time if I don’t graduate it would be dumb, as now I have an apartment that I wouldn’t be using for school. I would continue to rent it out though after I graduate obviously. 

I am wondering what you all think, does this make since, what is the grad rate in dental school as I also plan on taking over my dads practice once I graduate and it’s very important to me that the next 4 years go through smoothly. Is there any advice from anyone to ensure I graduate with my class. And some advice on the housing question. I have about 300000 saved up now for a down payment"

I have lived here with my late mother since she bought the home 15 years ago. But of course, as the old tale goes, the others all of a sudden wanna all live in here but not pay bills, taxes, upkeep, etc. I managed to acquire 3/7ths via quitclaim deed transfer, now I own 4/7ths interest, leaving only 3 siblings left to buy out. My goal is to buy them out in 2023, even if they don’t want to be bought out. In that case, I’ll file a Petition to Partition.

I guess the question is, how might I best leverage the equity in this property to gain additional properties? Looking to purchase a multifamily somewhere. Should I buy them out first then use HELOC to buy multifamily? Or should I focus on using the money I would buy them out with to buy the multifamily property first, then buy out the family home?

My goal is to begin creating a nice real estate portfolio. What is the best course of action I should take?"

*7 units (2x 2BR, 1BA and 5x 1BR, 1BA)

*Bones of the property are very good. New electrical, plumbing, roof, in the last ~9ish years. 

Will cash flow negative immediately, but once we are at $6700 will cash flow ~$400 a month, and then $800-$1000 years 3-5. Getting the rents up will increase the value to ~$900k in 5 years, which should make it easier for us to refi and pay the balloon. Seems like a solid deal.

We have up to $100K to start with. I'm looking for feedback on the idea of buying a parcel that is buildable but treed and not sewer- or water-connected, and then prepping it for building by clearing it and having septic and well added (after the requisite testing/permitting/surveying). Obviously this is a lot of legwork and requires several purchase contingencies, due diligence, and working with a variety of parties, but I value the experience. My main concerns are:

1. Would it actually be profitable when all is said and done, or are these kinds of improvements priced into the market? The sample size for comps on the MLS is really small.
2. It takes ages to sell vacant unimproved land. Is the market for turnkey ready-to-build land any better? Would I need relationships with developers?

I know this sub is mostly about BRRR, but that is a monumental commitment. I'm interested, but I don't feel prepared for that, and I worry a lot about the financial position that vacancies or contractor ripoffs could put us in.

3303,realestateinvesting,"Some years have been a sellers market, some years have been a buyers market, but in 2023 real estate isn’t looking good for anyone","With the start of a new year many are wondering who will have the upper hand in the real estate market. It’s sad to say but when you get down to it 2023 is looking horrible for both sides of the equation.

Governments across the world have been raising interest rates as a way to combat spiraling inflation that was a result of out of control spending. But what effect does raising interest rates have on the most interest rate-sensitive sector of the economy you might ask? Well it turns out it has resulted in mortgage rates doubling and and sales heavily declining. hopeful homebuyers are now completely priced out of a reasonable purchase and those looking to sell are met with a dearth of buyers.

These hard times are a cold wake up call to many especially in the US market which saw a 124 month consecutive streak of home prices increasing in value. This took place between February 2012 and June 2022 and this streak made many feel like the good times would last forever. But just as many thought they were untouchable a new streak was started, between June 2022 and October 2022 there was four consecutive months of home prices decreasing in value. Buyers that bought at the top of the pandemic housing boom quickly found themselves underwater.

In the real estate market there is constant bad blood between buyers and sellers. Buyers often look at those who already own property as bad actors profiting off of a necessity, while sellers see those looking to acquire their property as entitled and seeking to undercut the value of their property. In this market were both sides are starting to lose their are certainly some that find enjoyment in the other sides misfortune. But for those that haven’t allowed the market to become a personal matter, one of the only feelings they’ll have is hopelessness as things continue to decline.

Moving forward one question that could answer which direction the real estate market moves is what will interest rates be going forward? The Fed expects interest rates to reach 5.1% in 2023, 4.1% in 2024 and 3.1% in 2025. Whether the rates actually match that pattern is anyone’s guess.

An economics team at Realtor.com has predicted that home prices will rise by 5.4 in 2023. While Wells Fargo has things going in the complete opposite direction and they predict home prices will decline by 5.5% in 2023. The range of estimates between top analysts grows by the day and is a sign of the uncertain times we’re in.

Inventories for new homes are currently very low and they’ve set historic lows in the past few months. Usually low inventory would result in an increase in prices but demand has remained weak. It’s expected that new listings will continue declining through 2023 and there will still be a lack of buyers able to take these properties off the market as the year goes on.

For the foreseeable future it seems we are stuck in a loop that sees both seller’s and buyer’s continue to lose with neither side getting what they want. This leaves many wondering how long this period of loss will last, all that’s certain is both sides of the market would like to see it come to an end.

Forewarning: word vomit.

Lately I've been working on different businesses, which in turn require me to open different LLC's, meaning more bank accounts. I admit, I am a fairly unorganized person, and can only imagine how much harder it'll get as I obtain more businesses.

I am a real estate investor and small business owner and currently own 3 properties, 2 of which are on the same LLC that I am partnered with a friend on, and one that I own myself. We also operate a demo company under the same LLC. (I know, terrible idea. I'm working on separating them.)

For current and future rental properties, I imagine I should be opening different bank accounts because they are each under different LLC's, but in doing so, adds to the ""clutter"". I was wondering if has any recommendations on how to keep these better organized. I imagine using one bank would help, but even so I would have to open 2 accounts: one for expenses and rental income, and one for security deposit. Also, if I have a tenant Zelle/CashApp/Venmo rent, these accounts are linked to my personal checking and I can't imagine having to open different ACH services for each LLC, and having a different email/phone number for each.

Ideally I would want one account where I can receive rent payments, and another where I can transfer security deposits for ALL of the LLC's, but from my understanding that's considered comingling. 

Another issue I'm facing is that when it comes to expenses, I would want to put things on a business credit card, but I would once again face the same problem of commingling.

I just want to be able to keep better books for tax purposes.

I'm sure there's other concerns I have, but these are what come to mind."
3309,realestateinvesting,Rental market slowing more than normal (even accounting for winter seasonality)?," 

Hi All,

I'm looking at purchasing a triplex and renting out two of the units, but I keep hearing from multiple rental economists that:

A) rental demand since September has been weaker than normal

B) Even though this hasn't happened in the past, rents could fall year/over-year by end of 2023 given the record supply of multi-family units coming to market next year

C) Household formation slowed down quite a bit in 2022. If layoffs accelerate, I worry this could further stymie demand for rentals

Chris Salivati on Twitter:

It's typical to see prices dip at this time of year as rental market activity slows, but what we're seeing now goes beyond seasonality alone See the price changes from Sept to Dec over the past 5 years: **2018: -1.1% 2019: -1.4% 2020: -1.2% 2021: +0.4% 2022: -2.7%**"

I also checked AirBNB. Some flats were partly booked (you can see in the calendar the availability dates). But most of them don’t have a single booking ahead. So it does not seem like there is a lot of demand for short-term too.

I would put down 5%. With my credit union I wouldn't have mortgage insurance so that saves me a lot and I could do a 5/5 arm. I normally am not really happy with arms but a rate adjustment every 5 years seems worth it since it could get me a 5.9% rate. (Versus 7 for a fixed)


What I am having trouble figuring out is how ppl then rent the house later? If I put 5% down it seems that I would be paying essentially what the market rent would be. Basically  there would not be any room for me to increase rent much.

3329,realestateinvesting,Have you been one of multiple investors in a commercial deal? How did it go?,"I'm considering investing in a commercial deal. I would have approximate a 1/15 share. I've read through the contract and it seems fairly straightforward. 

Among the negatives are that I could lose part or all of my principal, I do not have any decision making rights, the managers have a wide range of discretion although there are guidelines. 

The management team plans to pay themselves 20% of income for property management, which is more than double what I've paid for residential property management. However there is likely 24 hour staff.

This is a coworker abnb in Mexico. The property has not yet been purchased. It is in escrow. 

The payout at my level is 14-16% annual, very good. 

I consider myself to be generally cautious if not pessimistic. I tend to ask a lot of questions that other investors don't ask. The principal I talked to was patient and, although he of course wanted to put a good spin on their business model, his assumptions seemed fairly reasonable. One premise with which I disagree is that this type of real estate is more or less immune to the changing residential market. 

One thing I like is that members are at the top of the list to be paid, as I understand it. I can sell my position, starting one year after the initial investment, but that is beholden to the decision of management. Otherwise my exit opportunities, return of principal, occur if the deal is refinanced or sold. 

At the end of the day it is an unsecured loan. I give someone 100k, they give me a piece of paper. If they don't or can't pay my only option is litigation I suppose. Despite all this negativity, I suspect other investors join deals like this and make money, while I sit on the sidelines.

I've looked at a property that is $1.5mil with a $900/m HOA but it is beachside, has covered parking and a large pool. 

I'm just curious what I need to know. I own my own home and have been a homeowner for 20 years but have not done rental property. Ideally I would like the property to cashflow itself but tell me if that is an unreasonable expectation. I had a friend who bought cabins in the Pigeon Forge area 10 years ago and he said he only made his money buy selling them (just last year at the top of the market of course) but said really all he tried to do each year was break even. I think I would be ok with that, understanding that a big capital investment might cause a few bad years.

Not only do you make great money, but you also get to help people turn their lives around in the process. North Carolina currently doesn’t have any certifications that are necessary to own/operate a sober living home. There’s constantly waitlists for people trying to get a bed at these places, so that makes it obvious that the demand is high. I have been working on a plan, and a vision for a place like this, I just don’t have the money to put down to rent a house. Usually a 5 bedroom house can go anywhere from $2,800-$5,000 a month. Typically, there are two twin beds in each room. On average, each client pays $1,000 for rent monthly. You can do the math on that! I am really passionate about sobriety, recovery, and helping people to learn how to function sober as a productive member of society again. So, ideally I’d take care of the day to day business with the clients and stuff around the house/talking to potential clients and their families, and etc. you’d just be renting the house!

3343,realestateinvesting,Turbotax question," 

Hi all, I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.

My brother and I inherited a manufactured home and land in Florida. I bought out his interest, renovated it and am now renting it (we finally found a tenant mid December, so almost no income last year). I used a HELOC on my primary home to finance the renovation, and pay off my brother. We kept every single receipt. Our plan (my wife and I) is to take 100% of the rental income and pay the HELOC, so from my perspective this will result in a 0 net increase in cash flow. Since it's all going to debt is it considered income? Also since all of our renovations expense receipts were in 2022, but the income won't start significantly until 2023 am I still able to use it as a deduction?

I've prepared my own taxes using Turbotax for more than 10 years, and if possible I'd be fine with continuing on that path, but I'm a little unsure how to approach this. It seems like it should be a fairly common situation, and the rest of our fincances are fairly standard, income from jobs type situation.

Can someone point me in the right direction and give me the broad strokes of what's required? or should I not go down this path and go find a CPA? If I need a CPA what should I look for as qualifiers for a good CPA? 

Thanks for the guidance!"

3349,realestateinvesting,Why is the rule of thumb that house prices fall 10% for each 1% rise in interest rates?,"Someone quoted this 'fact' to me yesterday, and it got me thinking about where it comes from.

For monthly payments to stay the same, and assuming a mortgage makes up the majority of a house's value, then the formula is:

**p1r1 = p2r2**  (where p = price and r = rate)

If rates rise 1%, then r2 = r1+1

From here we can derive:

**p2/p1 = r1/(r1+1)**

In other words, the ratio of the new price over the old price equals the ratio of the old rate over the new rate, for payments to stay the same.

So for example, if rates go from 2% to 3%, then house prices should fall such that p2/p1 = 2/3, a drop of 33%. Clearly the 10% ""rule"" didn't hold up. What about for higher rates? Say rates rise from 9% to 10%. Then prices drop by 10%. 

So does this mean the ""rule"" only holds somewhat true for higher rates around 10%?

I also can't figure out how to take equity into account, as it changes from person to person. Clearly the price of a property has both an equity component and a mortgage component for most people, but that ratio varies.

Finally, economic situation may mean that people are more willing to stretch their budgets when rates are high. They accept they will be poorer for a while. This would mean that prices don't drop as much with rising rates as the math would indicate. But in fact we saw the opposite: As rates dropped to zero, a bubble formed and people were buying on pure FOMO.

Thoughts on this?"
3350,realestateinvesting,Tom Cruz Section 8 Course is a SCAM,"I wanted to get into real estate, but I didn't know exactly where I wanted to start. Seeing Tom Cruz all over TikTok and Instagram talking about how great Section 8 investing was, got me hooked. So, I messaged him asking questions about the course and how S8 investing worked and the legal side to it and all... and he was great.

One of his recruiters (Ben Frost) called me to talk everything over and answer any questions I had about the course and the coaching that was to be involved. After being reassured that Tom was going to hold my hand for my first few deals along with hand-picked seller financed deals claiming $2500-$5000 down sent to me, I without a doubt signed my life away.

It all went downhill from there. It was almost impossible to even get in touch with Tom, let alone be coached or get any direction from him. When he FINALLY got in touch and sent the ""Hand-picked seller financed deals"" to me, they were just piss poor Zillow listings... What a disappointment. No contact had been made to the seller or the homeowner like they had promised. No seller financing negation had even been thought of. It was expected that I do all of this when that's not what I even signed up and paid for. I was promised hand-picked CONFIRMED seller financing with $2500-$5000 down deals, when questioned about any of it, Tom just becomes defensive and deflects.

The discord community is the only value you get from the course. The other people in there actually help each other out and answer your questions. I have had about 10 other discord members DM me expressing their disappointment, but they are too scared to say anything in fear of being kicked out like the ones before have that spoke up. If any part of the process (scam) gets questioned, your chats get deleted by the mods, and the chats responding to them get deleted also.

Also, all the videos of testimonies, they are all paid for. Tom runs promotions and gives stuff away to send in video testimonies of how wonderful and great the course is. Which I get. But it's all fake. It's like a Tom cult. Everybody kisses the ground he walks on just to get noticed, then they talk about how bad everything is in direct message groups we have that he can't see. It is pitiful.

I am just over 10k in the hole with the entire operation. Such a poor judgement on my part. Unless you have 100k+ just sitting in the bank, you will gain nothing but heartache and disappointment from Tom. It is all catered to the ones that have copious amounts of money to begin with. If you don't have much (like me), please don't waste your money. You will get the same value from the ""Section 8 Bible"" book by Michael McLean &amp; Nick Cipirano as you do from the course. It is almost identical. It makes me think that the whole idea of the course was from this book to begin with.

Please heed my warning. Stop giving this guy money."
3351,realestateinvesting,multifamily question,"I just want to run something past you all.

I'm considering a multifamily home -- asking is $800k, commission is 3% on top of that (negotiable -- and I'll negotiate this down), 7 units 2BR/1BA, 1 unit 3 BR/2BA.

currently, I believe owner charges what is essentially $300 per bedroom, which is WAY low for the area. I think I could charge $450‐$500 per bedroom. Taxes in the area isn't awful, but higher than rest of state (about 1.03% FMV per year).

How does one decide whether this is a ""worth it"" investment? By my estimation, it is, but I'm worried that I make the investment, go in and change carpet, put in new paint, and somehow end up deep in the red.

I'll be able to put the 20% down and will have some money to be able to make any changes as I need. I'm also considering property management (unsure) just so I don't have to worry about the headache as much and can focus more energy on other ventures. 

When I calculate cost of everything (taxes, insurance, property management fees, closing, utilities), I'm calculating that this could end up being $80k I. The bank annually in about 12 years, but I worry I'm missing some massive elements in my equation. 

Finding tenants shouldn't be a major issue, but the annual lease to month-to-month makes me a little nervous (feel more secure with locked in lease every year).

Of course, appreciation is ideal but that seems unreliable, and there seems to be an inverse relation between CoC returns and appreciation (probably because of more speculative investors in hotter markets who are less concerned with cashflow and/or are more cash heavy on entry). 

Does commercial have better CoC returns? It seems to me that the only way to get good CoC return in residential is to buy in low demand markets where appreciation is relatively unlikely. Not to mention you take on the risk of debt and the unpredictability of repairs etc. which can wipe out months or even years of positive cashflow.

3386,realestateinvesting,"Houston TX, New Construction Quadplex Using Primary Residence Loan, Homeowner As General Contractor","I’m looking for some feedback on my plan. 

I currently own 1 SFH that I rent out, while I live in an apartment. The cap rate for the house was 20%, since I lived in it for a year before renting it out and my down payment was 3.5%. Cash flow: $300/mo after everything including maintenance fund, $400/mo in equity. $20k was the initial investment, $60k in equity is currently stored in the home ($40k came from home price increase).

My goal is to build a quadplex in a suburban area, move into 1 unit for 1yr+, and rent out the other 3. Each unit would be a 2000sqft 2 story 3/2 (no garage). Rental rates in the area range from $1-$1.3 per sqft. 

I would be general contracting the build myself, doing the framing myself, and MEP systems myself (I’m a mechanical engineer that spent 2 years designing MEP systems for oilfield equipment. I’ve been reading IRC 2021, and I don’t foresee any systems I’m not confident installing myself). Foundation, painting, and potentially roofing I would contract out. 

The relationships I need to build before I start this project are with a land realtor, an architect/structural engineer, a real estate attorney, and a local bank, which I intend to develop through some REIA meetings in my area. 

My goal is to spend $100k-$150k on the land, $300k-$350k on the building, and use a primary residence new construction loan to do it. 20% down would mean I need $80k-$100k to get the new construction loan. I have $70k in liquid assets (non retirement stocks, cash), and another $60k in home equity. So that puts my skin in the game at $130k. Unfortunately, this would mean selling the SFH I currently have.

The part where things get hairy is the bank loan. Building your own home without a general contractor’s license is legal to do. However, if a bank sees that I want to use a primary residence new construction loan to build 4 front doors, the general contractor is the same as the loanee, and the general contractor is unlicensed, I can’t see a bank willing to make that loan. I could spend the next 6 months getting my general contracting license to check the box, but the other parameters still apply.

Has anyone gone through a similar experience that they can comment with?"

However, the duplex sits on a hill and there is some foundation damage. To fix it, I would need to drive 14 pillars/pilings into the foundation and lift a slab that is sinking. Additionally, one of the units has been renovated, but the other needs new flooring and doors on some rooms. I got some contractors/engineers out to estimate the cost of repairing the foundation and renovating the one unit: 

\- 3-5k for each pillar (70k total)

\- 5k to lift the slab.

\- 20k to fully renovate the one unit

So let's say total cost of the duplex including renovations would be 280k. Similar units in the surrounding areas are all around 300-400k. 

Assuming I can get a construction loan around the same interest as the mortgage and a conservative $1300/month rent for both 2b/2ba units of the duplex:

3421,realestateinvesting,Calling REI professionals," 

* *My apology for the long post.* 

Greetings everyone,

I am new to RE investing, but I've always been passionate about real estate, buildings, and design. However, I have been reading and participating in forums for quite some time, and I think I am finally in the position to make my first step. Here is my situation, I work a healthcare administrative job that pays decently a year, and unfortunately my NY life sometimes really drains off my piggy bank to the max.   
The monthly expenses here are getting crazier as each day passes and I basically forgot the definition of the word ""savings"". I am very much willing and capable of traveling (out of state) to find a better life and investing environment and even so, leave my W-2 job when the time comes. For the longest time, I had planned to invest in the TX and FL metro areas (pre-pandemic), but the recent price/interest surges have made these areas not great for cash flow. Maybe I'm wrong...

However, I decided to focus on my own state market (NY) where houses in certain areas are more affordable and the rents are relatively high. At the moment, I have a multi-family duplex I'm eyeing on but definitely need some help executing the project. While these investments will mainly be for cash flow, I will only invest in an area where properties will greatly appreciate. I've narrowed down a few and I currently am using all kinds of approaches for my research and eventually pull the trigger very soon. My overall goal is to buy and hold and create a scalable portfolio of vertically integrated cash-flowing properties, and for that, I'll do my utmost toward my mission until I reach some form of financial independence.   


I would love to connect with experienced investors like Realtors, Lenders, Property Managers, Attorneys, CPAs, and REI professionals willing to partner up, share advice and guide thru experience and resources. Please feel free to email or pm me at any time! I am an avid learner and believe that mutually-beneficial relationships are most successful ones. 

Thank you!"

3423,realestateinvesting,Winter storm affected my duplex. Owner occupied. Under builder warranty.,"I live in OK and we just last week got hit with the polar vortex. Temps were at 0 with wind chills near -30 in my town. Tough. 

Some quick backstory: I've got a newly built, 2022 duplex that I bought from a local builder. I feel like the work was phoned in now that I've lived here for 6 months and thankfully I'm still under warranty so the repairs have been covered. 

After this crazy winter storm, I noticed some alarming changes in my home. I have verified it's happened to both sides of the duplex:

 • Upper cabinets are pulling away from the wall. Talking a 1/4 inch. Further than you can fill with caulk and call it good. 

 • One exterior window made loud snapping noises during the storm and I see it pulling away from the wall. Both the window and the sill. 

 • Cracks started appearing in various door frames at the corners where the 45°s meet.

 • Flooring is turning up around the bathtub. 

 • There might be one thing I'm missing.

I've notified the builder of all of this and have requested a full walkthrough inspection. There's no longer a construction supervisor as of December, so no timeline set on the walkthrough. I'm also considering paying for a Structural Engineering Inspection and am kicking myself for not spending the money up front, but I would've been out +$5k if I had broken the contract. 

What are my options here? Am I going about this the right way? Any help to come out on top in this situation would help tremendously. I'm working off my own intuition, but I'm in need of other opinions and advice if y'all are kind enough to give it. 

Thank you!"

I have been doing my research into the BRRRR method but I'm not entirely sure how to strategize. We currently rent a condo in Seattle, and we've talked a lot about purchasing a home together but we have differing opinions on strategy - he wants to buy a home for ourselves first and I want to buy an investment property first. I believe the market is going to decline in the coming year and I want to make sure we are taking full advantage of it. The goal, for me, is to BRRRR until we are financially independent.

For context - 

* We both make 6 figures (which in Seattle means we live comfortably but not comfortably enough to buy a home)
* Neither of us have ever used an FHA loan or owned a home
* Between us we have a decent (10ish%) down payment saved up for a condo in this area, we also have access to retirement funds we could pull out penalty free
* We could also ask for loans from family members to reach a 20% down payment if there was a strategic reason for it
* Both have great credit scores (mid 700s)
* We plan to get married in September 2023
* He is a first responder and I am a software engineer (in case anyone knows of any special rules)
* Our jobs are very flexible so it wouldn't be completely out of the realm of possibility to buy property in another state

My questions -

1. Would it be a bad plan to delay our official legal marriage (get married but only spiritually), purchase one home with an FHA loan in one of our names, occupy it for a year, and then buy a second home with the other person's FHA loan and rent out the first home?
2. As I understand it you can have exponential growth with the BRRRR method if you save up the money to buy the home outright first, add value by rehabing, then refinance the home. I believe the market is going to fall in the coming year and I don't think I'll have enough money saved in time to catch this wave. Am I just sh\*t out of luck?
3. If you were me, what would you do if your goal was eventually to get into BRRRR full time?"

\--Mistakes--

I made a ton. After my finances are back in order I will eventually go after another deal, but it will be a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Budget:  I went wayyyy over budget. Not shopping around for a contractor really hurt me. I would recommend getting three estimates before closing on a house in the future. 
* Contractor: I went with the contractor who could start the soonest as I was eager to begin the work. They had good reviews on Google but they were very slow. Nearly a year later there are still a few odds and ends they need to take care off. Looking back I should have vetted the contractor with a lot more scrutiny. Additionally, I subcontracted elements of the project (HVAC &amp; Electric) out myself as I thought I could save some money. Ultimately I think it cost me more headaches and money to do it this way. In the future I would hire one general contractor to handle all the work.      Furthermore, do not pay a contractor before all the work is done. I settled up with my GC even though there was still about $600 work of work remaining from our contract and now I cannot get them to come back over. 
* Analysis: I had no concept of what cash on cash or a cap rate even was when I put an offer in on this house. I got really lucky with my first rental in that it cash flows well. This house would have been a big loser even if I had stayed within budget. There are so many tools on this sub to analysis a deal, but I ignored all of them and went with my gut. 
* Finances: I was not in a position to do a full gut. Without really any prior experience, I based estimate off outdated statement of works from a prior kitchen reno, and nearly ruined myself financially. I would recommend for the beginners out there to have ample cash on hand before attempting a major renovation. Ask yourself, if this project's budget doubled, or something      major happens, what would I do?
* Interest Rates: A large part of my plan revolved around the idea that I could refinance the house after the seasoning period and get all my cash out to pay back the loans I took out for the renovations. As we saw the interest rates rise, I could no longer afford this strategy and am now stuck with about $60k in additional loans. 
* DIY: In an effort to save money I did half the floors and all of the painting. I will have to re-do the floors as I used LVP and did a horrible job installing them. I thought I could get away without using knee pads, but after a day or two of installation, I could barely walk and rushed through the work. DIY work is definitely not as fun as it appears on TV. In the future I would only consider purchasing a property that I could afford to have all of the work contracted out. 

\--Personal Life--

I was extremely lucky to have the support of my family - especially my parents. Without their support I would have ended up in a dire situation. 

I was angry with myself for a little bit and I felt like a failure. After I got done feeling sorry for myself, I realized that besides the house issues I had things pretty dang good. My extended family grew this year as siblings got married and had children. Being an uncle is a pretty awesome thing. My work is meaningful and enjoyable. Life is good.

I would urge those considering jumping into real estate to do their homework. If only I had done more research and understood the risks of what I was trying to do, I could have saved myself a lot of grief. I fell in love with the idea of being a real estate investor, without understanding the effort and risks involved. 

Financially, I have been able to re-establish my emergency fund, and am making aggressive payments towards my debts. I did pause all retirement contributions for a while, but am thinking of restarting them soon. My plan is to take care of the credit card debt this year with a $10,000 bonus I'm set to receive in July. I'll pay off the home equity loan in 2025 after 36 payments (I'm paying an extra \~$410 a month). The personal loan will take the full five years to pay off. 

Lastly, someone on the initial post said, ""this too shall pass"" and those words have stuck with me. Thank you kind stranger. You have no idea how much that meant."

3461,realestateinvesting,To sell or rent out? Open to all opinions!,"Im in the process of looking for a new home but am exploring the idea of keeping my current home as a rental. I dont have any investments in real estate yet, this would be my first one. 

My current home is a fully updated 3 bed, 1 bath at 936 square feet. The payment, taxes, and insurance are $625 a month at a 3.275 interest rate. The loan is $95,000 and started in June of this past year when I refinanced. 

If I sell, I believe I would walk away with 40,000 as a down payment after I pay closing costs. Im looking at homes in the 275,000 to 300k price range.

I believe I could rent the home for 1,100 or 1,200 a month. There aren't any major expenses for the home currently, nor none that I see in the near future (furnace, AC are new, nice appliances, etc). 

I do think it would be better long term to rent out, but I would have to put hardly anything down on the new home, which I don't particularly like. Is it dumb to do it that way? 

I've considered going to talk to a financial advisor, I don't really have any family or anything to help me make a decision. But I thought maybe I could get a couple of ideas here first. If you took the time to read all that thank you and I would appreciate any advice!

The home was in beat up shape. I probably paid too much for it. But nothing was making sense in RE at the time. I put \~35k materials + countless hours into it between paint, floors, two bathroom renos, replaced half the windows, put in central AC + ductwork. Replaced all switches and receptacles. New ceiling fans. The kitchen could use updating, but I'm done sinking $. A similar (flipped) one down the street sold for $270k about 6 months after I bought mine. On the same busy street that I can't stand.

If I sold mine for $270k, after costs I'd be lucky to get my downpayment + material $ back. I'd have just done 100's of hours of labor for free. Would a solid plan be to rent it out for 3 years, then assess whether to sell it for tax reasons at year 5? Or just keep renting it out if all is good?

I bought it with the intention of renting it out after a year, but after how much work it was renovating with a FT job. Idk how you guys do it.

2) Buy a larger property for $150k yielding $1600 a month in rent.  Save the 75k on my HELOC and let it build until I can buy another unit for 100k to 120k.  

Both would be studs in maintenance only and both are pretty nicely updated.

I currently am in college studying Operations and Supply Chain management, and serving in the US Army Reserve as an interior electrician. I will be graduating in spring of 2024 (however I could graduate this coming fall if I wanted to) I will be getting out of the Army Reserve in August of 2025, this is part of why I'm in no rush to graduate early as I will still be stuck in Wisconsin for a year after I graduate in 2024 anyways. When I graduate, I will have zero debt (No car note, mortgage, student loans, kids, absolutely nothing). Right now I have about 15k in the bank just sitting, unsure of what to do with it now in order to contribute to my future. I have an Internship that pays 20 an hour and save about 80% of my money. Now with all that background information out of the way, I wanted to ask this subreddit, what should I do to get into real estate when I graduate and what is it I should be doing now to ensure a successful future in real estate? Should I be investing my money into assets like crypto in hopes of the bull run hitting right when I graduate, or instead into stocks, or maybe neither and continue to save?! Should I work a year after I graduate and save all that money for a down payment on a rental property? Maybe do airbnb?  Maybe I should do house hacking instead using my VA loan once my military contract is up? Maybe I should do all of those things?

I feel there is so many opportunities available to me, however I just am unsure what path will lead to the most success. One path I know I will not do is wholesaling, been there tried that, not for me. The prospect of owning rental properties and creating a portfolio around that is very enticing to me.

Now I currently live in Wisconsin, I do KNOW I would like to move somewhere warmer, been thinking about Florida, but it is crazy how expensive property is there right now. However if I did airbnb down there it may be worth the risk when I graduate... I think?

I'm curious to hear what you seasoned real estate investors have to say and what you think about my situation, what path and steps would you personally take if in my situation. I appreciate and sort of tips, or guidance! I will be quick to respond to any questions.

The area is zoned in such a way that allows for 3 additional units to be built on the same lot (it's surrounded by multi family properties).
I'd like to build the 3 additional units on the same lot to create additional rental income and appreciation.
Where do I start? The lot has a pretty big slope that serves as the driveway to enter the property so I'm certain some groundwork needs to happen to make this work.
Who should I look for to find the highest and best use of this lot? I'm imagining like an architect that draws out different possible unit configurations that meet local codes and see which makes the most sense to build out.
Is that who I need to contact? A local architect? I'm sure I need to bring in sewer and maybe other utilities. Does the architect do that too?

I got a loan for 5.75% and unit A rents for $1135 a month and unit B rents for $1260 a month. After PITI + PM it cash flows about $400 a month and is paying down $187 in equity per month.   


I don't love the area, definitely over renovated, the tenants have been subpar but not terrible (they are paying and the property is in good condition still but for a 94k investment that I can't get back without selling it's not worth it. 4% of 94k in a high savings account or CD would yield me $300 + a month with no work or risk. Learned a lot on this one to say the least so I don't regret it per say.  


The question is do I offload it for a slight loss or hold it and play the long game considering it does cash flow, equity will build, and the rate is favorable?   


Let me know if you have any questions but I'd love to get everyone's thoughts. I'd either use the funds to purchase our forever home primary residence or a better investment.

I've been reading through this sub for the past couple of weeks, but still pretty stumped on where to start or what I want to do. From what I've read, NYC is not a great place to invest, but this is where I am and I feel I have a few advantages. 

I'm in my late 20s and have a very nice career that is starting to yield some good capital and I feel I need to do something smart with it. By mid summer, I'll have about $150k-$200k capital to use as a down payment. My wife and I have a combined income that can range from $350k-$500k (I'm commission based).

I would love to invest in a multifamily that I could live in for the first couple of years. I know tenant rights aren't great for owners in NYC, but I work from home 2 days/week and my wife is in healthcare, so she's also home 2-3 days/week. The company I work for has a mechanical and plumbing service division who I'm close with and would either do emergency maintenance work or know the right people for me (meaning I won't get screwed on costs there). My father is a retired contractor and my wife's father is a retired fireman, who works part-time as a building super. With that in mind, I'm less concerned about maintenance issues. 

My biggest concern is how to figure out if a deal is good and if I can find renters. Do you have recommendations on how to search for this, books to read, etc? I'm colorblind and the maps that overlay rent with subway info is basically impossible for me to understand. 

I'm really drawn to the throggs neck/country club part of the Bronx for some reason.

Maybe in 5 years, if they can keep scraping together the money for the mortgage and to pay off their other debts, they’ll be in a much better situation then me?

3512,realestateinvesting,"Arguing head and heart: can you help decide? Sell, reno, rent 1965 Austin home","I've been losing sleep over what I should do and I'm hoping to borrow some wisdom from you fine humans. I'm hoping that some of you can scare me straight. 

I own a 1965 brick ranch single family home. She's 2002 sq. ft. 3 bed/2 bath with a two car garage and an 18,000 gallon pool (I have no backyard it's essentially all pool) located 5 miles from downtown Austin. I bought her long ago with cash for $270k and have no mortgage. Plot twist: I somehow secured an amazing executive directorship position at U Chicago and they want me, permanently, in February. 

Here's my big dilemma... I love my little home but she does have some ""quirks"". The kitchen and bathrooms are dated and small. The garage is leaning a *bit* (a lot) to the left. She needs a new driveway, the pool needs resurfacing, and the deck needs to be redone. The plumbing under the house was redone but the ""ends"" of the plumbing are still cast iron to the new PVC so it gets clogged easily. 

If I sold her as is, I could get **so much house** in Chicago (tempting!) However, if you search for ""pool"" + ""garage"" + 2 bed 2 bath in Austin there are approximately 8 listings for single family homes that range from $499k-$1M. A big piece of me really wants to keep her for ""someday"" when I can be a snowbird or retiree and give her a full down to the studs reno. 

The pool and the one-off susceptibility to cold is the thing throwing me for a loop. The pipes WILL freeze if not aggressively managed. Also, pool maintenance can be a PITA if you're a novice or if you're not a person who stays on top of things. Rent for similar houses runs low end for $2000 up to $5900 in my neighborhood. Air conditioning in the summer combined with keeping the pool topped off can skyrocket the energy bills to $600. 

At this point in time I have a 822 credit score. However, due to student loans, two advanced degrees, and aggressive retirement savings, I've only got around $10k in savings. I was planning on taking 6 months and a HELOC to fix some of the basic stuff, rent her out for some cash flow, and find some place spartan to rent in Chicago. I will have a very competitive salary, but don't know if my plan is unmanageable considering my financial situation. 

My parents say to sell immediately but that's because they want me to sever ties being far away from my Wisconsin hometown. Hoping you all can help me get down to a sane decision considering some of the quirks involved. Thank you so very much!"

3521,realestateinvesting,When to make an offer on off-market home?,"So my wife and I found our dream home in the fall of 2022, it is a new construction that had just finished earlier in the year and they listed it for sale in June. It was likely a tad overpriced for its size so it stayed on the market for over 120 days with no price adjustments. There was plenty of action in terms of tours (we got this info from the agent) but never sold. On November 1 they took it off the market and we spoke to the listing agent and they told us that the builders are going to live in it for roughly a year while they build a different house nearby. This was great news for us as my wife is still in school and doesn’t graduate until this May, at which time she will start her new job and we will be ready to purchase. We have been preapproved for the mortgage, but now we are not sure when the best time to reach out and make an offer is. We don’t want to seem too eager so that they drive up the price for us but we also don’t want someone else swooping in and making an offer first. There is no guarantee of when they will re-list the house, it depends on how long it takes them to build the new one, but we are willing to let them continue to live in it until it is done (within reason) if they do accept our offer. When do you think would be the best time to reach out with an offer? 

Side note: we are also just feeling antsy so if we should wait until they re-list it please advise! Thank you!!"

3538,realestateinvesting,Advice needed to buy my first rental property abroad. What would you do if you were in my position?," 

I've been thinking a lot lately about how and where to buy my first real estate property. I have a stable job as a financial analyst and I freelance as a DJ on the side. I can earn up to $10,000 to $12,000 per month on a net basis. I live and come from Kuwait, where we don't have taxes. At the moment, I currently have around $80,000 saved but ideally I know I need to make more effort in saving. I can easily save $8000 per month as I live rent-free with very little expenses.I currently have zero debt, no commitments, not marriage etc.

I want to buy my first rental or commercial property and I do have a finance background so I'm good with numbers. Ideally, I'd want a yield of 7% or more per annum. 

In my country, our real estate is extremely expensive due to scarce land and monopolization of real estate mafias. Minimum for $200,000 gets you a very small apartment in an incredibly old building and not so good location.Therefore, I'm open to investing abroad.

**Credit lines:** If I wanted to maximize my credit lines, I would be eligible for a mortgage loan worth approximately $230,000 with monthly payments of $2100 from my bank. 

**What would you recommend for me to do to acquire my first rental property?** Which countries should I look into (as most likely I will also hire a property manager). I've thought about proximity to Kuwait, so countries like Turkey, UK, Portugal, Dubai.

3540,realestateinvesting,Father Passed Unexpectedly - Was Self-Managing 56 Doors,"Hi, all. (This is cross-posted - just an FYI)

My father passed away yesterday morning unexpectedly. He was 61 and had been slowly selling off a portfolio of SFH and duplexes that, at its peak, reached 100 doors. He self-managed these properties while working full-time. I also own 10 SFH that I self-manage and have been helping him on the properties for the last 20 or so years. He was down to 56 doors as of the beginning of the month. 

My stepmother is in no condition to make any decisions regarding these properties, all of which are currently rented except one, which is under contract to be sold. I work full-time, have two children under five, and a third on the way in 6 weeks. 

My question: Is it possible to get these houses under contract with a PM to buy us some breathing space, with the understanding that many of these properties could be sold in the next 12 months? In total, they rent for about 40-45k a month and are worth 2.5-3 million on the market in their current state, which includes some pretty significant deferred maintenance in some cases. There are no mortgages on the properties.

My thought would be to get them all under contract as soon as possible with a PM to avoid my stepmother having to decide what to do right now in terms of selling or keeping individual properties. She was much less involved in the business than I was, and she is understandably numb with grief. I'd like to have a flexible contract with a PM that allows us to sell individual properties throughout the year, either as they become vacant or as we make decisions on what to do with the portfolio, without incurring early termination penalties if individual properties are not managed for at least a 12 month term. 

Is this a reasonable contract to negotiate? Do you have any other advice regarding an arrangement that suits this situation? I know the prevailing wisdom is to not make big decisions when grieving, but I am unable to manage this portfolio myself for more than the next month or two. The alternative to a PM is selling them all outright over the next couple months, which seems like an even bigger, irrevocable decision that wouldn't be feasible anyway, given the complexity of his estate and the fact that the properties are spread between three LLCs.

I apologize if this is rambling, and thanks for any advice you can offer."

3547,realestateinvesting,"Apartment managers, What are your typical duties and expectations?","Just wondering how our managers duties compare to average. I mostly do remodels and repairs to our buildings. Im usually sent to help on issues our managers can't fix themselves. I personally think the managers are expected to do way more that what I would ever agree to, I recall my boss, owner of half the properties saying ""these manager positions are part time jobs, They're made for Somone to have a full time job elsewhere and then do a little more work when they come home"" 

&amp;#x200B;

My immediate thought is most people can't take care of their own house, let alone 30-40 units after a full time job smh. Anyway here's a list of a few things I hear my boss complain about them not being able to do. 

**Plumbing issues**\- backups that involve removing a toilet and running a Spartan 1065 (300+ pound drain snake) to eat up roots that come back every couple months. I personally would think the average in-house manager would call a company after the plunger or toilet auger failed to solve the problem. 

**Gutter cleaning** \- how often does a manager do the 1000+ feet of gutter cleaning on a sloped roof that has not tie points. 

**Roofing repair** \- Wet patching a flat roof with standing water in the rain

&amp;#x200B;

These properties take a lot of work and I don't see how a husband and wife team with two kids can have a healthy life even if just one of them is working a full time job. In our cases the wives appear to take care of the kids, rent and logging work orders and the husbands go to work and return to do trash duties, grounds cleaning, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $80k in expected renovation expenses coming up to finish the remaining couple units in my portfolio transformation. I'd rather renovate on loans than wait to accrue cash flow over 8-10 months to complete these. First time using debt for investing purposes outside of mortgages.

Any reason not to open a 0% card for expenses I can put on a CC (E.g., appliances, some materials from big box stores) instead of a 100k HELOC I have open on an investment property that's currently at ~9.5%? I'd guess 60-70% of costs will still go to HELOC but a 0% card seems like a no brainer, given confidence in being able to repay before the intro period ends (either througg W2 income or cash flow from units already renovated). Also plan to convert HELOC to fixed lower rate unless there is reason not to.

As mentioned, exit plan is to pay down with cash flow - do not intend to cash out refi as I'm at 3-4% fixed rates, though that's obviously plan B and plan C to sell if for some reason things were to come t"

But I can’t find any actual data on what kind of returns, overall, including leverage and tax treatment, DIY real estate investors are getting.

I look at REITs and commercial funds. They appear to have very competitive returns (10%+) for LPs. Some even have hit 20%. That’s a great ROI to me. 

I’m willing to do work to grow my wealth faster. What I would like to quantify is - how much better would my returns actually be?

I’m smart when it comes to investing in the market, but very limited in regards to real estate investing. 

Issue is we don’t have a lot of cash for a rental property. Selling our current home and purchasing a new home would give us a lot of cash to purchase a rental, but I’m worried the bank wouldn’t give us a loan to do so. 

We could refinance our current home to get the cash we need, but seems incredibly stupid to refinance for a much worse rate. Only positive is we would still own the house to rent in the future.

I feel like fully modernizing it could help me with another 150/250month and help me find better renters (unfortunately this building isn’t the prettiest and not in the best area yet. Location proximity is great though)

Is it worth spending 12k to just get me another 150-250/mo? 

Or should I just look to spend half (6k) to update bathroom, paint, new appliances, and small touches?

Any advice appreciated!"

3589,realestateinvesting,Help with my rental property math!,"Hello, I am at ground zero when it comes to real estate investing and I am trying to figure out how to calculate the ROI on a rental investment. Here is my long breakout but when I price everything out I keep getting negative cashflow, so I need help figuring out what is wrong with my math or if I thinking through this incorrectly.

I will be using an example for the home price. The area I am focused on has homes for rent in the $2700 to $3300 range and the homes are valued at around $400 to $500K. Here is my math:

Purchase Price - $500,000, Down Payment (20%) - $100,000, Interest Rate - 6.5 %, Closing Costs (6%) - $30,000, Renovation (12%) - $60,000 ----&gt; Total Cash Needed Upfront = $190,000

Estimated Rental Income= $3,000

Monthly Expenses= Principal &amp; Interest - $2,528, Property Taxes (1% of Property Value) - $417, Insurance (0.8% of Property Value) - $333, and no HOA fees (specifically for this property) ----&gt; Total Monthly Expenses = $3,278

Deductions from Gross Profit= Vacancy (10% of monthly rental income) - $300, Repairs (5%) - $150, Maintenance (5%) - $150, and Property Management (5%) - $150 ----&gt; Total to deduct from gross monthly rental income = $750

So if I use those values and calculate \[(monthly rental income) - (monthly expenses)\] - deductions = negative cashflow of ($1,028).

I know I am screwing something up, any help is greatly appreciated!"

3595,realestateinvesting,Thinking about leasing with option to buy(RENT TO OWN),"Thinking about Leasing with option to buy(RENT TO OWN)

I’m an investor looking for people to put in my rental property. And I’ve been wanting better tenants and a higher cash flow. So I’ve been sitting on the fence about lease with option to buy. 

Would you take your house price and 3-5% of that would be the option fee, that the tenant gets back when they execute their option? And you get to add a premium to your rent, say the rent is 1800 normally so for this you would make the rent 2,000. And would you give them a credit for $300 off the purchase price of the house. Or a net total off the purchase price for them $500 credit? 

What’s the best way to set up the purchase price? The best thing for them would be slightly over the price right now so they would get all the appreciation. And the best thing for the investor is to sell it at the appraised value, so he can make all the appreciation. Is there an in between? Where we both get to make a good amount of appreciation? 

Another question is the option fee is it an interest free loan? Why would they want to put money in and it not increase? 

What I want to do is to find a house under market value. Buy and put a tenant in that will want to buy the house in a couple of years. So I’ll make some money on the equity when I bought the house, some cash flow, and then some appreciation. 

And what I want for the tenant, is to actually gain a net% of equity in the house when they are ready to buy. I want to do everything to help them buy it as long as it doesn’t hurt me. 

So to sum it all up can someone tell me some good numbers to start structuring a lease option?"

3607,realestateinvesting,new to rental property investing. Would love some advice. What is the best way to predict a trend in housing demand in specific geographical locations that would drive housing prices up?,"I'd like to purchase a deal on a property that would appreciate in value at a higher rate than market average. 

For example, the kind of deal I'm looking to find is:

Through some research I hope to find maybe a town or village that is building a factory or other opportunity creating many new jobs and or other incentives for people to move there. I hope to identify some data that suggests there is a trend starting which suggests an increase in moving to that town or the next few years and I'm hoping to also identify a location where there are no new housing projects in the next 10 years in that area meaning supply stays fixed or shrinks. 

I'm thinking a rental in that area, unless I'm mistaken, would he a good property to buy for cashflow that would also appreciate well over a period of 5 to 10 years due to a speculated increase in demand with a shrinking or fix in supply. This would add additional capital gains to the investment leveraging the spotted trend in housing prices in that chosen area for a higher yield. 

What tools or strategies could I use to research these trends in a small geographical area in terms of demand from people moving or no housing projects flooding supply on the market, that I could use to speculate price increase in a given area?

I have the idea that this would be ideal to look for, but I'm struggling on the research process as well as knowing where is best locations to start looking for such an opportunity. Any advice would he appreciated.

I got the house in 2019, and I was lucky to have saved up enough for a down payment, but now I don’t have enough saved for another down payment if I get a new house and rent out my current one.  My sister loves my current home, and said she’d love to rent it if I ever consider.  

The houses in my city that are 4 bed and 2-3 bathrooms are about 360-400k.  I can realistically do a $1600-$1850 mortgage, but right now my mortgage is $1300 a month.  If I rent my house to my sister for 1700 a month, take a home equity loan, use that extra 400 my sister would give me, and use that to pay it off, and get a new house that’s about 370k and put a large down payment to bring it down to around 280ish, would that work? 

Or is there another option to go?  I’d like to not sell my current house, it’s in a great area, but I know in the next few years I will need a larger house"

3616,realestateinvesting,Show a home before application?,I’m curious how you all handles this.   I have people wanting to see the home we have listed for rent but none want to apply first. We tell them we would prefer they apply before we show it and then they typically go radio silence from there.  We use Zillow for applications so it does cost them $25 for a month.  We figure if they are serious about renting them they will be wanting to apply to multiple places anyways so the $25 is nominal. Also protects some of their personal info using Zillow.  I guess I’m just wondering if we would be better off showing it without expecting the application first?  My fear is it will be a waste of time for “looky loos” and day dreamers and not really be a good use of our time.  Expecting the application beforehand allows us to prescreen things like income etc.   I would appreciate your thoughts.  Thanks!

When we go through the numbers, we would be essentially cash flow neutral on the current home as a rental. 

Our debate is honestly going to come down to personal choices, but I am curious what others here would do. If we sell, we have cash to build a (much needed) garage at the new place and have some added life perks. If we hold and rent, there is a possibility of future appreciation while the property covers itself, even though we do not anticipate cash flow. We also do not anticipate major cap ex in the near future as we just replaced all major systems in the past 3 years. I can personally argue it either way, so I am looking for thoughts from others in real estate."

We live in Minnesota, which based on my research is a “non-recourse” state. However, I talked to a bankruptcy attorney during a free consultation and he said that if there is a deficiency on the sale of the house, they could come after us for the difference. Is this true?

3638,realestateinvesting,Sky high interest rates vs ever growing demand. What do you think 2023 will bring?,How do you all see the next year playing out? I am seeing new home construction come to a screeching halt with the interest rates climbing but the need for homes is of course always increasing. Some prices are falling but many sellers are still trying to get 2021 prices. Seems like the whole sector is a series of contradictions. Is anyone going to come out a winner?
3639,realestateinvesting,Expectation of property manager with a situation involving neighbor,"Hi folks, I have a property manager for a rental SFH. Earlier this month, I received my monthly statement from the manager and was informed then that a repair had to be done on the backyard fence because the neighbor's dogs had gotten through and into the yard. The $300 expense was taken out of my rental income.

What bothers me is that my property manager did not make any attempt to have a conversation with the neighbor and the damage caused by their dogs, before or after the repair. He only asked when I got my statement if I knew the neighbor because these situations are best handled owner-to-owner. I explained that I didn't, and I made it clear that I expect some attempt from management to remediate with the neighbor.

This is my first rental property so I would like to ask the community what they think. Is a professional property management company expected to go to the neighbor and talk about the situation and any financial responsibility? In my view, I'm paying them to manage the property so I don't have to. If I were self-managing, I most definitely would have knocked on my neighbor's door and talked about it at the very least, so I expect the same of a manager."

3656,realestateinvesting,Inheritance: Sell or Rent?,"Hello guys, newby investor, have been looking into this industry for quite some time now, currently saving up and being my best to be a sponge. 
My grandfather wants to give me his home (worth 400k) due to him being in hospice care at the moment. Although I don’t want to have these thoughts,he wants me to make the best decision for my future. He has made a life enhancement deed aka a lady bird and I will inherit the home when the time comes, hopefully light years away. He wants me to sell the property but I am not sure if it is a wise decision. No mortgage on the home, great area for growth. I was thinking of one of two options, either I sell the home and buy a quadplex using a FHA or I would keep the property and rent it out which I could get around 2400/m. As of now, college kid living with parents, no debt, two jobs just trying to set myself up for more &amp; better. 
Not to sure what to do, if anybody has any advice, tips, suggestions that’ll be greatly appreciated. Thank you for the read. Happy holidays guys"

3667,realestateinvesting,FHA Duplex investing,"I’m sure this has been asked multiple times on here but I’m new to Reddit. 

I’m a young finance major interested in purchasing a duplex through an FHA loan and renting out one side while I live in the other side. Afterwards, I’d like to repeat the process with another duplex.

I understand lenders expect the rent to essentially cancel out the initial mortgage before they will consider a new loan on another duplex. However, I have a few questions. 

I couldn’t figure out if you need to wait 12 months before you rent the unoccupied side of the duplex or 12 months before you move out and rent the side you were initially residing in?

I was also confused about the necessity for landlords experience to buy an additional duplex/investment property?

Any input, advice or personal experiences is greatly appreciated. Also if there are any catches or “fine text” issues I’m missing regarding this strategy, I’d appreciate any forewarning. Thanks!"

3669,realestateinvesting,What are my options for a loan for upgrades to my three unit?,"I’m newer to the rental scene. In the spring of 21 I bought a three unit house for 270k @3.25% and I get $3250 a month in rent combined. Mortgage is $1500 without insurance, which is around another $135 a month. I don’t plan on selling this unit ever unless I was forced to. 

I have done nothing to this property since I bought it and it has been cash flowing well. 

This house really needs a new roof, siding and windows. I haven’t even gotten quotes yet but let’s say I need to dump 60k into this place. 

What are my options in this scenario? I probably could have gotten creative when I bought the place and had a rehab number as part of the loan which would have been smarter of me. Since my interest rate is so low, refinancing is not an option. Would a lender look at my cash flow only and give me a loan based on that? I would prefer to get a loan that is not tied directly to my personal DTI, but rather just the house itself and tie in the payments to my current mortgage. 

Any thoughts would help me out since I have never gotten to the rehab stage on a buy and hold rental house yet."

3676,realestateinvesting,Using Equity in Rental for Hard Money Down Payment?,"New-ish investor question.

My husband and I have bought and sold quite a few properties, being military we have utilized both of our VA entitlements and usually kept the houses as rentals for a few years after moving out, then sold them. We have also been pretty successful buying land, holding for a few years and then selling those parcels for a profit.

Most recently, we took $110k from a land sale and rolled that into our first actual ""investment"" property that we purchased in March. We were able to qualify for the conventional loan based on rental potential - $399k purchase price for a new construction home, $295k current mortgage, 4.75% interest rate and it cash flows about $300/month. 

There is another property I am interested in our area that just came for sale, another new construction that would cash flow approximately $300/month as well if we were able to put $100k down on it and get an interest rate of 7-ish percent (give or take). However, we have only been in our primary residence for a little over a year and used a VA no-down loan, so there isn't enough equity here to do a HELOC for the down payment. Our local lenders have told us that in order to pull money out of our rental property, we have to have 2 years of rental income - we will only be at a year in March. 

I thought I have read in the past about the potential to use equity in a different property to count for the down payment on a hard money loan, but wasn't sure if this is my new investor ignorance or something that a hard money lender would actually do? Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you!"

 I'm struggling to understand how to compensate for this in my calculations. What would you do?

I also have $16k of “fair market rent and additional living expenses” in my policy which is more than 12 months rent.

At this point I guess I’m just looking for any advice or suggestions. My plans for now is to immediately start calling contractors (I work in commercial construction so have some contacts) to review the scope and provide estimates. In the mean time, I plan to repair the water line myself so the tenants can move back in, then work out any relocation/lost rent details when it’s time to start work on the kitchen.

I understand scaling up rental properties can get you a good money but they are plenty of problems that are coming with it. I live in Canada and my parents have rental properties. From what they told me, even if someone is really late on his payments you can't exclude him that easily. Also, tenants who mistreats the appartement you really can't exclude them because it's not a valid reason. In Quebec, there's a thing called regie du logement it's like a tribunal for lanlords and tenants. They are the one who decide if the reason of exclusion  whether is valid or not.

3687,realestateinvesting,How do people compound so fast?,"So I am young and goy a lot of ambition and passion to achieve financial freedom. I was brainstorming and thinking about my 10-year plan.

I see a lot of people turning little money into multi-millions in a span of 5 years. I know they might have gotten lucky and were there at the right time(in terms of appreciation), but when doing the math and projecting out 10 years, I am progressing very slowly in terms of net worth. What am I missing?

Math:

Let's assume my salary is 90K. Let's assume I somehow save 60K a year. In year 1, I use my savings to buy a 300K multi-unit using an FHA loan at 3.5% down. I buy a duplex and live in one of the units, and let's assume I cashflow $2000/yr.

After Year 1, I have 60K in savings from my job + 2K from property 1, so 62K and now I buy 20% down on another 300K multi units. Assume this one cashflow is 5K/year since I won't be living in it.

In year 2, I have 60K + 2K + 5K. 67K. Can buy a 350K property now with 20% down.

And so on.

Let's say I continue to do this for the next 10 years. Wouldn't I be progressing relatively slowly? I would hit 1M - 2M net worth at best after 10 years. However, some people build up to 5M+ in less time. What am I missing? How can I use more leverage?

I am being very optimistic with these numbers as well since it is very hard to save 60K from 90K salary after taxes. Also, I am not even taking into account cash flow taxes."

3689,realestateinvesting,Quick Question / Help Structuring an STR Deal,"My dad came to me and asked if I can help find him a property to AirBnB / create an STR out of in Nashville, TN. He has $400,000 - $500,000 cash he is willing to invest and wants me to find the property for him. Him and my mom want to visit say 3-4 times a year and then Airbnb the rest of the time. I am working with realtors in TN as we speak (\*nothing has been signed).  


I was talking with my wife and trying to figure out a way to fit myself into this deal. I have always wanted to invest in real estate and I love the idea of owning an STR property in Nashville, TN alongside my dad as partners!   


The problem I am having is coming up with a way to structure a deal to work together!

&amp;#x200B;

 I have $15,000 cash I am willing to invest, which obviously isnt a lot and Im having trouble trying to come up with a way to invest alongside my dad and get some sort of equity or % of the monthly income the STR would bring in.    


Say I put in $15,000, my dad puts in the rest to equal 20% down on a $600,000 property = $120,000 total, $105,000 of my dads, say $15,000 of mine, that would equate too 2.5% ownership, and lets say I get 2.5% of the monthly income the property brings in, thats a paltry number. or 2.5% of equity in the property, that doesnt equate to much either. I would love to somehow put this money in and earn an additional $100-$200 a month while having equity in the property and my dad can take the rest of the profits after mortgage payments, expenses, etc.    


I am happy to do this for my dad as a favor but id like to make it worth it for me to spend the time finding 5-10 properties (have to imagine a bunch wont work), maybe more!   


If I cant come up with any ideas on structuring the deal, I will obviously do this as a favor, but im just trying to spitball someway to invest alongside him and help me in building assets  


Any ideas on ways to structure a deal that would work for me &amp; him?   


Thanks guys! I hope I dont come across as trying to take advantage of my dad in this post, that is not my intention at all, I am happy to do this for him as a favor and spend the time finding properties, working with the agent, etc."

Of course, the sales price is double what the seller paid for it so I suppose they're ""assuming"" a buyer has a lot of cash lying around or could get a HELOC or 2nd for the difference.

3696,realestateinvesting,Trying to understand how to calculate cap rates. What am I missing?,"Trying to analyze several commercial properties and compare them through their cap rates.  But it seems like every property has a different understanding of ""expenses. ""  

Ex. Just looked at a nice duplex with the rents listed,  and the annual expenses listed at $3050.  Seems low but ok.   Then 3 lines down their annual taxes are $3658.... what exactly would the annual expenses be factoring in if not including taxes? 

Ex. Another 4 plex had something similar.  Where the annual expenses don't seem to include the $782 a month HOA fee. 

Is there a better way to get an idea of the expenses or do you generally need to make a few offers and get some real due diligence opportunities before you get a truer understanding of the expenses?

Also came with a section 8 tenant ($1500/m from program plus a check for $300/m from her) that the previous owner never requested fair market value from housing authority for years. Now, while I work on  finding out rules about getting money separate from the tenant, i am also seeing fair market value of 2br is close to $2500. 


I've never worked with section 8 but I presume there are periodic inspections to keep a unit in compliance. If I request a raise in rent with the housing authority, I expect an inspection and potentially find a bunch of things the prior owner never updated to code.

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies if I wrote this post bias..

&amp;#x200B;

My beloved wife and I are looking to purchase our first home together, and theres 2 homes we're deciding with... and would LOVE to get some advice and opinions! We currently have 140k in savings and we recently got new jobs, earning about 95k per year. Our combined total monthly paycheck looks around 9-10k.

  
There are 2 homes we're currently looking at, and our opinions don't quite align.

1. 400k, 4b/2b fixer upper with \~80k (20%) down on a fixer upper, and rent out every other room. Mortgage would be about 3000 per month, and if 3 rooms gets rented out, we would be net positive about $200 per month.
2. 1.1m, 3b,2b ""the dream home"", with \~115k down (10%) and rent out every other room. Mortgage would be about 8400 per month, and 2 rooms get rented out, we would be paying about 5-6k per month...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning towards option 1. Because it is a lot safer and we can exit ""anytime"" without having to worry about much. If one of us were to lose our jobs, monthly payments wouldnt be too big of a stressor.

My wife is leaning towards option 2. Because the neighborhood is better, and more convenient to get around. She also feels that option 1 might have a harder time finding tenants, whereas option 2 is flooded with folks who need a place to rent. Our family (god forbids) can also help out a bit with mortgage payments if needed, but none of us wants to go that route.

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently renting an apartment for almost 3000 per month, so option 1 feels super safe. But option 2 is ""just another \~2-3k away"". What would you do and why?"

3720,realestateinvesting,What would you do? Advice needed for my residential property,"What would you do? Options for my residential property

My primary residence is in a large metro area in the Midwest.  I've owned it for about 8 years and refi'd in 2019 to a 15-year note at 3.25%.  I'm in my mid-40s.  I got a very good deal when I initially purchased it and it appears it has probably doubled to tripled in value in our current market.  

The house was built in the 1940s on TWO lots that were never properly joined.  I essentially own two lots.  Most of the house is on one lot and a connected garage and possible part of a bedroom is on the other.  I'd like to maximize my potential value with this home.  This is idea is waaaaaaaay outside the box for me, but i think there's some potential for me to profit here.

Also the house, while nice, is too small for us and we'd like to get something newer.

As I see it I have several options available to me:

1. Do nothing and ride out the existing loan and have a paid off home in my mid 50s.  This would normally be my default attitude.
2. Do some sort of cash out refi and use that money for a substantial down payment on a home we like AND rent out the current home
3. Do some sort of cash out refi.  modify the current home so it only sits on 1 lot and sell or build on the other lot.  I live in a desirable location and there are not a lot of building lots available in the area.  I've noticed teardowns and lot splits happening in the area too.  Also my home at one time only stood on the one lot.  I'd basically be returning it to that config.  The existing unimproved portion of 2nd lot is big but too small to build on according to current local regs. 
4. Do option 3 and build and either sell or rent both properties.  Or live in one and rent/sell the other.
5. Or your rockstar idea i haven't thought of.

What would you do to maximize the value of this property?

Full Story:

I own a MF building in NJ and live next door. An ambulance arrived in the afternoon and one of the tenants, a single female, leaves in a stretcher. Shortly after, she texts me saying she is going to hospital for medical issue, and asks that I check her door is closed and locked and bring in any mail for her.

I twist the door knob and find that it is open and am immediately greeted with flies and a foul odor. I look in to see a disheveled mess of trash, fluids, food, belongings, a few empty alcohol bottles.

Speaking with other tenants, all are surprised to hear that she was home, saying that they had not seen or heard from her in weeks and she had not gotten her mail or packages.

Very surprised, as she has lived in the unit for over a year, is always very polite, always pays on time and I don't believe she normally lives this way, but I can't be sure. I want to be considerate given that this seem like a medical and perhaps mental health issue but I am unsure of the best way to proceed.  I certainly want to protect the unit from inevitable pest infestations and damage if it is left as-is."
3723,realestateinvesting,EU (Portugal) mortgage for non-resident from the US,"Hi all, 

I live in the US and would like to get a Portuguese residence and eventually a citizenship. 

I would like to see if any big international bank that works in both the US and Portugal will lend me $500K for that. I would think it has to be a bank that operates in Portugal, or else how would they foreclose on you if something goes wrong, etc. 

I would see it as a second home purchase - 20% down, get an appraisal. 

I understand it’s an investing Reddit, so might not the best place to ask. 

The game plan is to buy it, hold for 5 years and get a citizenship and then sell. If I lose $100-150K, it will still be a tremendous gain because of tax and other business opportunities EU citizenship will give me. 

But ideally I will rent the property out and have the tenants (regular rental or STR) cover the expenses, so I sell without losses or for a small gain. 

I understand there are many risks, such as FX risk, recession overall, Portuguese economy tanking, etc. 

But the question is really about borrowing. My income would allow me to borrow $500K super easily, but I cannot refi cash out enough money via my US assets. Could just put 20-30% down. 

Experience with any EU country as a non-resident will help!

I can't divide the lot and sell the open space because it's the backyard.  I could build a single-family, a duplex, a three-plex, a four-stall garage.  (I don't see garage spaces for the existing four units adding more than $50-$100 to each rent.) 

I'd love to have more units, but with new-construction costs and hassles, it seems I could just buy another duplex or triple somewhere else in the area for much cheaper and less work.  How do you make a new-construction duplex make financial sense?  2-beds go for $1400-1600 in the area. 

Anybody have any bright ideas or angles on how to utilize this space? Storage? Rent it out for winter boat parking?  Airbnb treehouse?  Ice skating rink?

My wife and I got married in 2019 and had planned on selling the townhouse and buying a SFH in the summer of 2020. Once the pandemic hit we stuck to our plan amidst the chaos and ended up buying in September of that year and locked in a 3% rate on a 30 year fixed mortgage.

My only regret is that I put 20% down to avoid PMI and get the best rate possible, but consequently we have less capital to invest in other real estate. We’re now thinking of turning our current house into a rental because it’s a good area for it and we’re never selling this house, but with mortgages so high it’s tough to find another primary residence that fits our needs and budget because prices here haven’t dropped much if any since it’s a LCOL area.

Any advice? Obviously, we can’t cash out refinance on our current house due to our rate being so advantageous, and furthermore I really don’t want to tap into the equity at all if possible, like via a HELOC for instance. In my mind that’s kind of a last resort. We owe 180k on the house and it’s worth around 300k (bought for 240k). Most of my money is tied up in the stock market, so I also don’t want to sell any of those assets while they’re down, but I’m really focused on diversifying our portfolio into real estate to get out of the rat race in less than 20 years by the time we both turn 50.

First - details of the potential deal below:

Large and unique single family home (\~5,700 sq ft) plus a large garage with apartment above it on the same lot. Would use both as short term rentals. Seller is interested in paying to occupy the property post sale for a predetermined period of time while they find new housing arrangements, removes their belongings, etc. Of note, but not overly important, seller is very tidy and keeps the property maintained. Their ""rent"" would cover the costs of the loan while I fix the garage unit to be income producing, and seller would continue to pay utilities, etc.

Garage apartment needs some work, but almost all aesthetic and will be income producing within a month. Seller knows this would be the plan.

I'm qualified for the loan, but cannot do a second home loan (which may allow a lesser down payment of 10%) because this home is in the same zip code as I am, so have to do a standard investment loan it seems. I have the cash to put a down payment of 20%, but I'm really trying to find a way to keep most of my emergency fund just that - for an emergency and not draw from this.

Looking for a private lender has been confusing and cumbersome, but I think the deal makes sense. I've reached out to friends/family about loans from them and have not had any interest. 

Any advice for finding private money lenders or hard money lenders to help cover the down payment? I've read through tons of threads on here, and many of them say things like ""just look harder,"" so hoping to get some general direction on where/how to do just that. Thanks! "

3755,realestateinvesting,Is it possible to double dip loans at multiple financial institutions?,"I recently saw a post about someone who managed to leverage within 5 years to 7 properties (currently renting it to tenants). 

The way he describes it is  that he borrows money to purchase a property, then rents it out and somehow refinances it or get an additional loan and purchase another property to rent out.

From what i know his income does not allow him to repay that many interest, but nonetheless apparently he found a way? 

I was wondering how he did it. I'm assuming that the person in question has been getting loans left and right from multiple financial institution to purchase more properties. 

Is it possible/legal to get loans from multiple financial institutions at the same time? E.g i borrow from bank 1 -&gt; 400k and again bank 2 -&gt;400k which means i have a total debt of 800k... 

Also. i am Canadian and this for properties located in Canada.

Thank you for answering."
3756,realestateinvesting,how do you get started in real estate,"As the title says I want to know how you get started in real estate, my mom's landlord says that you need a real estate license to be a landlord but I'm going to look up Massachusetts' laws on being a landlord because that doesn't sound right at all, I know you need a realtor's license to sell property as a broker, but my mom's landlord says that you also need one buy property as well. 

The reason I was thinking about getting into real estate was so I can convert some of the old factories and warehouses in my city into real affordable housing instead of what I see being done now which is to market as affordable housing but when it's finished they turn out to be lofts which not many people can afford to rent/buy in the first place. I also want to build micro-apartments that I want to rent out for $500/mo I know it's not a lot but I was thinking about someone who just turned 18 and wants to move out of their parents' house kind of market them as starter apartments.

I also don't have much money for now as I'm working on getting my degree and a job afterwards. Then there's this idea that I though of when I saw people building shipping container homes and thought of turning those into tiny homes as well."

I recently sold my property management company and want to spread my investments elsewhere. We want to buy a quad or so to test the areas then get 20-50 units complexes preferably.


I have no idea how to even start.   I am in a medium sized college town and so I know they bring in plenty of population. (None of my tenants are students).  So I have been looking at cities with popular""known"" colleges. 

But besides that I feel like I'm just shooting in the dark hoping to hit a town that makes sense. 


For example I've had my eyes on Akron Ohio. We have isolated a number of potential buys there. We were planning a trip to go see some properties in April.  I am also on a wholesale list for properties in and around the area.  Lately they have been flooding my inbox which leaves me to the conclusion it may not be a good place to buy due to the huge amount of homes being wholesaled.


How do you put there decide where to even begin to research specific areas to invest?"

3763,realestateinvesting,Escrow going up!?,"I own a duplex (a&amp;b) that’s next to another  duplex(c&amp;d).

Early November I got a property tax bill intended for my neighbor but with my name on it. This is how I found out about the mistake.
Today I received a letter from my mortgage lender saying my escrow is going up $28.00 a month. Is that normal or are they adding the property tax of half of my neighbors duplex? Or is mortgage/escrow completely different than my city messing up my addressing and adding a third building to it?

Has anyone here done it and if you have, can you share some feedback of your experience, to fix and flip a home but skipping the initial purchase. Meaning, instead of buying, fixing, and then selling, I were to find a homeowner who would like to sell but their home can use some work and they don’t have the money to fix it, so I come in and pay for the rehab on condition they sell and then when they sell, I get a piece of the extra profit which resulted from the “fixes” ive made…this is the general idea.

The main reason this idea intrigues me is the fact that I would need less capital per deal plus not have typical holding costs. 

Let’s assume I’m using my own cash to finance the project, so no financing involved here.

The professor explains to adjust each comp to that of the subject property. This includes, square-footage, bathrooms, bedrooms and certain features. 

The lecture seems to be aimed at future realtors and appraisers to come up with precise valuations. Although, from watching asking prices--[exhibit A](https://imgur.com/a/SK1EQg3)\--I wonder if it's really necessary to be so precise; asking prices seem to frequently just match similar properties at the time. A more effort filled valuation does not seem useful. Thoughts?

Two Sheboygan (WI) properties of the first image are both asking $110k. Bed/bath:

* 4/1.5, 1350 sq-ft
* 3/1.5, 1180 sq-ft

- Does anyone have an example of a subject to contract that they have used in the past?
- Payments: How does the buyer take over the payment of the sellers, do they pay the sellers and they pay? Take login information from the seller or switch the account drawn? Concerns are obviously not allowing the seller to mess things up, and also alerting the mortgage company that the house has been sold, causing them to ask for early repayment
- Insurance: Can i just get a new insurance policy in my name only once the property has been sold? Do i need to add the mortgage company?
- Do you need a title company to actually do something on this? I would think escrow funds and maybe update the deed/ abstract?

I know some of these are state specific, but would love any helpful information or experience you guys have regarding these specific deals! Thank you!"
3772,realestateinvesting,Would you rent or buy as an existing home owner?,"We are in the process of trying to have kids and want to gain an extra bedroom and a garage in a house. Our current house has gone up 120% since we purchased it 8 years ago and the profits would go a long way to the down payment of a nicer option. However, given we don’t need the space just yet. Would you consider selling your home while the prices are still high and buy back when they correct further? 

The idea is that the highly anticipated recession may finally come around and lower the price of homes. It would be awful to go under on a new house when we could have just waited a little longer. The housing market would have to make a house dip further than the cost of renting for a year ($24k) to be worth it. Our target house would be between $450k and $500k in the current market."

3777,realestateinvesting,Old house on an acre right in the middle of small town BC.,"So the grandparents are both gone and I have an uncle in the house.  The property is paid off, has been for years, and the time is coming to figure out what to do.

It's a not a nice house.  I can't see anyone paying a dime for it, but the land itself is great real estate.  Large and near schools.

What options do we have?

Zero chance this thing would pass a home inspection.  I'd be shocked if the plumbing wasn't glass and asbestos was everywhere.

The wiring is totally beyond code.  

I think the house was built in the 20's, and an addition was added in the 60's, give or take.

Also, pretty sure it's haunted by my grandparents.  
I want to start the thought process with my uncle.  I want him to sell it and come out to where I am because he's single, no kids.  Someone has to be close to help him out.  

He deserves it.  I doubt he has much of a nest egg to rely on in coming years and he's 60 now, so retirement is a bit of a pipe dream.  This house is in his name so I'd like to see him with that."

3790,realestateinvesting,"Is the assumed 7% SP500 growth unsustainable long-term, and would that make real estate investing more important?","Maybe I'm thinking too much, as they blocked me from posting a similar discussion question to this on the personal finance sub, but I'm genuinely concerned and would love to hear some other opinions on this. 

I've heard for years that we can assume the SP500/good index funds will grow at 7-10% per year, meaning in retirement people can pull 5% of their investment per year and still have a balance that grows to keep up with inflation over time. 

Then I learned a little more about whats going on in Japan. With their main change being population hitting a stablizing/shrinking point, their annual GDP has on average increased 0.43% per year over the past 42 years. With America's growth rate slowing and concerns about this, I've thought more and more about the likelihood that our GDP growth/market growth will slow significantly by the time I retire in 25+ years. 

That is one of the reasons I've been more excited about keeping real estate investments. If we eventually live in a world where 2-4% market growth per year becomes the standard, it will ruin retirement plans for many people. However, real estate investments that cashflow would still provide retirement income. 

Maybe its a dumb game to try and predict world economies 25+ years out, but I'm starting to question the assumption that 7-10% market growth per year on average will be a reality in my older years. Anyone else had similar thoughts, or any input I'm not seeing as to how something like this would impact the value of real estate?"

This is much different than the way inventory is typically measured. I hear that inventory was low for the recent run up and in fact it's been low in California (my home) for 15 years. 

In my region there were multiple vacant bank owned properties during the Great Recession. There were constant news stories about this and you could see them all over. In fact, I bought two of them in 2012 for chump change. Meanwhile, the rate of homelessness did not increase in like kind. 

I've been searching on Fred and other sites for this data and have found it elusive. So far the most relevant I have found is houses completed per month and I can find housing starts and building permits, etc.

Unless there are less living units than people in my mind there is not a true housing shortage. I'm painting with a broad brush but I think this is an important part of the discussion regarding inventory.

I could then scale much MUCH quicker and get out of my W2 job literally a decade quicker. Not to mention that all lenders ive talked to want six months reserves in the bank for all mortgages, which essentially means that once Im on fourplex #3, for example, Id need roughly $35-40k in the bank in LCOL area whereas if that were in an HCOL area, yeah thats basically like triple so $90k saved which is not all that possible given my income or would take years longer, let alone then having to save up for that 5% for each purchase ($45k vs $15k). Just seems impossible to owner-occupy in HCOL, working your way up one 4-plex at a time, if you make $100k and your goal is to ""retire"" off of real estate some day. If my math is wrong or someone sees it differently do let me know.

3826,realestateinvesting,How much work on a first property is too much work?,"Hey guys I'm in an interesting situation. 

I have the opportunity to buy a house in a very very good location that houses never go on market for (I'm currently renting the place). The house has recieved roof damage and subsequent water damage. The financials work okay for house hacking but there's a chance 1) that it's actually a money pit and 2) that the work is actually too much

Here's the hard finances. Owner wants 325k for the house. He will replace the roof (new) and he will take off the water damage quote from asking price. The water damage is isolated to one side of the duplex so one side is livable, but the other side (our side) has damage to the subfloor from a leaking tub. So 305k for the house and an additional reno loan for 20k for the water damage repairs. 

In short the place needs 

- One sides walls gutted from the water 

- a complete bathroom + kitchen renovation on one side to replace the tub and damaged floor 

- entirely new electric (cloth wire and 2 prong plugs) 

- new plumbing (cast iron) 

- some minor foundation work

This would be something like 50k total in renovations? And we figure the house would be untenable on the damaged side for 6mo to 1yr. The rent is 1500-2k per unit in this neighborhood. So vacancy costs would be another 12k+. So for 60k+ we could look at houses in the 375k range, with less work, with immediate returns with tenants. The house would probably appraise for 400k with all this work, and would then rent out for 1.6k on the side were not using. I've run the math with my partner multiple times but something is holding us back and I think it's because it's our first time buying and there's too many unknowns. 

Very much appreciate you guys advice and wisdom! Thank you!"

I know there are an almost infinite # of ways to get there, but I was hoping to hear from people who are actually doing it, how you do it!

How many units spread across how many properties? What was your initial start up costs vs monthly expenses? How much do you owe, how much value in your properties? Is it through a lot of smaller, low income properties, or 1 or 2 high value properties? Are you using a management company or not, and if so, how much are they taking per unit/per property?

In other words, can you show us ""the math"" on how you clear $5k or more each month? I think it will be fascinating to see all of the different answers.

If the standard deduction for 2023 is $13,850, to get the maximum yearly tax deduction from depreciation of a rental property it would have to be at 13,850 x 27.5 years or at least 380k correct? 

Yes I am assuming the standard deduction amount won't go up just for example. 

In other words. If I buy a 200k rental property I'd be leaving some depreciation tax deduction on the table right?

I have W2 and 1099 income not from real estate. 

Besides depreciation, mortgage interest, management company, insurance, repairs, are there any other tax benefits? 

Tbh, if I buy a 500k condo to get the maximum yearly depreciation deduction, I don't think the tax savings will really move the needle for me. 

Is it worth it? Seems like the big win would really be from the condo appreciating in value and doing 1031s after that?

Is it better to sell and buy bigger property or keep the first property and aim to buy another small property with 20% down. 

For example, let’s say year 0 i am buying 300k property and put 20k down using fha loan ( i know i only need to put 3.5% min) and generate 5k cash flow after 1 year. And after 1 year I have 60k in savings (from job). So now will have 65K in cash and 20k+ equity in property 1. Should i sell property 1 and use fha loan and put 85k as 3.5% down on a 2.8M property or use that 65k to put 20% down on a 350k 2nd property? 

Going the sell and buy bigger property will generate more cash since more leverage with the 3.5% down right? 


If i go this route, is it better to go SFH or multi unit on the first property?"

3847,realestateinvesting,When will the attractiveness of real estate as an investment finally change to reflect a high interest environment?,"The global financial crisis of 2008 led to a prolonged period of low interest rates, which has particularly benefited the real estate market through the availability of leverage through mortgages. However, investor Howard Marks recently warned of a potential shift in the investment environment, with higher interest rates potentially here to stay for the foreseeable future, in his memo ""Sea Change"". While real estate seems to be characterized by remarkable gains, a fundamental change may be upon us. In late 2021, many stock investors ignored the possibility of a market pullback, even when the Fed signaled that interest rate hikes were likely to start near year's end / early 2022.

I wonder if real estate investors too will be late to realize the full consequence of the headwinds we're facing. For now, it seems a lot of investors are simply waiting for some price dip to enter the market, but how would they feel if they knew a future of unremarkable capital gains lay ahead?

I note on this subreddit, some investors are preparing to refinance in the future to rationalize a marginally attractive investment in the current conditions. However, it might be unrealistic to expect rates to reflect what we've seen in the last 10 years if we look at what rates looked like the past decades.

I think the general real estate investor mentality reflects a lot of recency bias.

Real estate may be the last domino to fall in my opinion. A lot of renters are still eating through savings accumulated through the pandemic, and credit utilization is hitting all time highs. If unemployment finally increases to uncomfortable levels and places pressure on rents (and that's a big if), I wonder if that might start to push real estate into being much less attractive an investment."

Purchase Price- $165K
Money Down: $10K 
Term- 30 yr/4.25
Payoff- $135k
Est. Value- ~$230k

Anyone familiar with the DC/MD rental/housing market have any insight into my current situation.

Pie in the sky I know but the idea sounds cool to me. I'm probably older than a lot of you so I guess that's my headspace.

3899,realestateinvesting,Lender won’t put credits in initial disclosure,"Going through a refi to pull out equity and reached out to several lenders. Amerisave is one of the few to offer rates on this size mortgage on a multi-family and their offer beats my standard lender by more than a point.

However, they put a $500 non-refundable application fee in the disclosure, while over text they said there are no fees aside from the appraisal if I back out. I asked them to remove it before I lock in rates and they said “that’s just the disclosure. I can’t edit the Loan Estimate as it’s a government regulated form. Otherwise .. something about hidden fees. Let’s let this text be our agreement for the credit I’m offering you.” Is this legitimate or BS? Most of their reviews are people having to pay a $500 fee and then all their docs get lost and they never close.

3910,realestateinvesting,Single family rental in HOA controlled neighborhood,"Currently own a Single family home in a Class A neighborhood, great school district in a HOA neighborhood, as my primary residence. I would like to rent this property out starting in May however in reviewing my CC&amp;R (HOA documents) there is language related to “rental restrictions”. Specifically while the HOA is still under developer control (which it is as they are completing a 6th phase), one of the restrictions is you must live in the home for 300 of the last 1,000 days. So based on that I think I could rent it out starting in May for 2 years but then it would be a gamble whether the HOA is still under developer control. Once the developer is finished building, the rental restrictions are removed. The downside, if you break these rental restrictions, the developer (per the CC&amp;Rs) has the right to purchase your home for up to one year after the violation is known, at your original purchase price, thus erasing any of my equity gains since owning. 

Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? I would much prefer to hold onto the property and rent, but there are possible consequences. 

Other relevant facts: market value might be $310k with $60k equity at 2.75% 30 year. Rental rate of $2,100/month seems likely."

I purchased my first rental property in 2019. A 4plex with 4 small 1 bedroom units. I have lived locally since I’ve purchased it so have just managed it on my own. I am now looking to take an extended vacation to escape the cold for a couple months and faced with the decision if I want to try to manage the property remotely, or should I just hire a property manager to have a boots on the ground person if needed. I have 3 tenants who are great, always pay on time, don’t have many requests, etc. and a new tenant moving in Jan 1st which also seems like a great tenant from what I know so far. My mind just goes to what would happen in the event of an emergency and I’m on the other side of the world. Unfortunately the tenants aren’t very handy either. 

Anyone here manager their property from different time zones? Or should I just bite the bullet and hire a property manager for $100-$200 per month? 

Currently the property cash flows about $1500 per month. Couple units are very under market rent but they’re great tenants so I’m just leaving it as is for now.

Trying to sell them all with a traditional or reverse 1031 exchange would be a logistical nightmare, and you'd most likely end up having to take well below market value on most of the properties in order sell them within the proper windows.  


Is there any reason you couldn't list and sell all the properties, and each time one sells, you 1031 it's value into a DST. Once you've completed the process of selling them all, you could then identify an apartment complex/commercial building to acquire, and then sell your DST shares and 1031 them all into this new acquisition?

3960,realestateinvesting,is it worth it to move to the US because of real estate investing?,"Hello everyone, 
I am from Spain (27M), I currently own an online business and reside in Dubai. I have been always in love with real estate investing but now that I have the chance and the funds to start the location is not great.

Dubai is a great place to live for anyone with an online business due to its 0% corporate/income tax, but in terms of real estate it is really volatile and the market can go up or down 15% in a single month without much reason meaning that cashflow is not stable. 

Also rents tend to go with the price of the market as well and in some places in US from my understanding it is not as common to see a -75% in rent income during a downturn like happens here. There is people here that bought property 10 years ago when the numbers made sense, and have not had a single cashflowing month since then, also corporate financing here it is not as good as in the US.

I know that I will have another two decent years with my business here and would like to liquidate everything and do an EB-5 or E-2 visa depending on the amount that I would like to spend on a business. I do not need to have the chance to apply for a green card but if it's on the table and I have plenty of funds for the EB-5 I wouldn't mind. Also the lock up, let say I buy a small motel for 1,5M with at least 10 employees just to be able to apply for a green card in the future, I couldn't leverage that. That is why I was thinking doing E-2 visa which is like 100-200k buy a small property management company and then start investing the rest of money at 20% down on different properties, as I said the green card is not the reason to go to US, I could stay on a temporary status as long as I don't have issue. If anyone knows if it's harder to finance bigger properties (12-24 units) while on a E-2 visa instead of a Eb-5 or green card please let me know.

So now the question, do you think it is worth it to move to the US just because cashflow/1031/leverage  in real estate compared to other places?

I could invest in Spain as well but there is no depreciation write-offs or 1031's and so and so, also the bureoucracy is not worth the hustle in my opinion and to cashflow I would need super sketchy apartments and given that my money came from a tax heaven it would be a nightmare to explain the tax authority. Also I do not like where the country is going that is why I left. 

I have studied for a while in US before and I like it a lot, I also lived in Canada and was planning to start investing there but I saw that there are not as many benefits as investing in US, also the weather is not the nicest and it is when my business started taking off so had to move here due to taxes.

Also the plan is not to live here and invest there, the plan would be to go there and go balls deep in Real estate to try to create a big portfolio.

Let me know what you think and thank you all.
 
P.S: I know investment visas are closed until end of 2023 probably beginning of 2024, also the market and financing rates are not good. The plan is to be there in two years or so."

Do you need to have a specific property in mind when you go talk to lenders?  Do you need to prepare a DSCR analysis specific to a property?

3972,realestateinvesting,Tenant eviction issue,"This is really just a rant. I have a commercial tenant in a strip mall in Michigan that dropped off the face of the earth and will not return calls or emails. He owes about 2 months rent. We tried calling I’ve 20 times and begged him to just sign the unit back over to us and we will work out the arrears. Instead, he decided to go dark and continue to rack up rent and potential damages. 

Okay, we file for eviction. We are in the process and cannot enter “his” unit without a court order so we wait. Well earlier this evening, water started pouring under his wall into the neighbors unit due to a burst pipe from the freezing temps. After hiring a locksmith and getting into the space after what is now considered an emergency, we are facing over $40,000 in damages. We will sue, but he is a piece of human garbage and likely uncollectable, so this will be fun. 

I just wanted to point out that all of this could have been avoided if he gave us back our keys. I’m tired of reading subreddits where people demonize landlords because it often does happen the other way as well. 

There, rant over."

Let’s say you have a situation where you have two people (one is a W2 and one is a 1099) that are thinking of putting forth 50k in a real estate investment in a commercial building hoping to offset this from their taxable income as they are filing joint.

3974,realestateinvesting,Should a discount factor be applied to the Cash-on-Cash return when comparing across years?,"Cash on cash return is pretty straightforward. If I put 20,000 down, and my cash flow after debt service is 1,000, then my CoC return is 1,000/20,000 = 5% for that first year. 

In year 2, let’s pretend that I was able to cash flow 1,500 this time instead. Now, my CoC in year 2 is 1,500/20,000 = 7.5%. 

But isn’t this comparing profits in year 2 with an expenditure from year 1? Not necessarily apples to oranges but it feels like that’s green apples to red apples. Should the cash flow in year 2 be discounted to be in year 1’s dollars? Or should the 20,000 from year 1 be inflated to year 2’s dollars? Or some other NPV consideration? 

TIA"

3993,realestateinvesting,Financing Options?,"My approach with my first rental house was to buy a house live in it for one to two years then move into a new house. This gave me 3% down for me in the first house (my wife wasn't on the first mortgage) then 3% for the second house (because my wife was a ""first-time homebuyer""). With the impending recession, we are thinking it may be good to invest in more assets in the next year or so if the market does in fact go down.

4016,realestateinvesting,Title Insurance Recommendations,"Hey Guys, does anyone know of a title insurance company that works in Georgia, that will insure a title with a DOJ lien. The case was back in 2014, and last month they put a lien on all of my properties. I have over $3M+ in properties with no outstanding mortgages and I can’t sell any of them because I can’t find a title insurance company that will insure any of the sales.

It’s a catch 22, If I can sell a house I can most certainly pay the civil judgement, but the red flag of a DOJ lien and the type of case makes companies very weary. 

Backstory: The Lien is just over $30k 
The case that the lien stems from is back from 2014 
It was a fraud conspiracy case 

Now, before I hear all of the negativity, I know it’s difficult, but I was hoping someone would know of a title company of the thousands out there that might give me one chance or at least someone can give me some ideas. 

It’s crazy because all of my companies are in LLC’s, the judgement is against me personally not the LLC, but using my energy to fight that when that same energy could be used to resolve the issue seems A bit more plausible 

Ideas that are out of the window: 

1.) Get a personal Loan to pay off the lien 
        I need to sell a property to pay off some debt to bring down my utilization and fix my credit to get a personal loan 

2.) Use Cash to pay off the loan 
      Buying and Rehabbing these properties out of pocket has got me cash strapped, which points back to reason #1, I have incurred a lot of debt where my utilization is extremely high 

3.) Borrow the Money from a Friend or Family
      All of my friends have lent me money to fix these houses and I am leveraged on that front, I need to sell a house to pay them back. 

I had a solid plan, but this just thew a monkey wrench in my plan 

Thanks so much in advance guys"

I have a legal question around house purchasing in California. 

An unmarried couple buys a house together and files as joint tenants (50/50 ownership). However, the down payment was not 50/50 (but more like 90/10) AND Person A on the 90% side used funds from a gift (with an associated gift letter) to pay for the down payment. The remaining mortgage is equally split 50/50. Do the two people have equal legal ownership over the house? Or does person A have 90% ownership because they used funds from a gift for the house purchase?"

4031,realestateinvesting,Take HELOC on current primary to use as down payment for new primary; transform old primary to investment.,"Hello investors,

I am considering taking out HELOC to use some of my current home equity towards a down payment on my next primary residence within 2023. This new property would be my second mortgaged property, with a goal of doing BRRR and being able to acquire a third property in Q1 2024. At that time, I would refinance property #2 to pay down some portion of the HELOC. My concern is that many banks say that HELOCs are held against a primary residence, and do not offer the product for investment properties. My situation is in a sort of gray area.

I want to make sure that I do this right--I am terrified of being called on the HELOC. After calling a couple different lenders (1 local and 1 national) they both told me that the bank can't really track what I am doing, so there is no reason that they would call my HELOC balance due. Essentially, they made it sound like ""don't ask, don't tell.""

Has anyone taken a HELOC on their primary, then changed their primary shortly after? How risky is it to take a HELOC and then move the property within an LLC to an investment property?

Thank you for your help! I am realizing that Home Equity solutions can become complicated rather quickly."

I would like to do a 1031 exchange for this property- its market value is at about 115k now (deducting seller's agent commission and other fees that I would accrue from selling it). 

If I do a 1031 exchange, does this mean that I would have 115K + 2K to invest into a replacement property (minus any transaction fees)? 

Is this a good idea? Honestly, I just want to get rid of one of my debts since it's becoming stressful. Would this leave me with an opening to make the profit I should be making off of my replacement property?  Do real estate folks use 1031 in this way or did I get the concept mixed up in my head?

If she earns more than that, but he is not working or in less than that, can he just take the entire profit and then pay no tax on it? Is there a limit on how much capital gains you can pay no taxes on? Is there a restriction on a partnership of two people a portioning the income that way, all to one of the two people?

- Window is”janky”
- Fridge water filter needs to be replaced
- The cement ground where the garage door shuts on is uneven (earthquakes shifted it a hair)
- They wanted exterminators to come 3x a week to check rat traps. There were never rats in the house for all the years I lived there.
- Light bulbs need to be replaced.

There was a very detailed inspection report with no problems found.

I am curious about bidding.  I am fine with paying the current asking price.  Of course I would like to get it for less.

The agent told me there has been alot of interest and several bids.  I assume none have been the full asking price or it would be sold.  The bid resets every day at midnight.  On the website it shows extended.  

If I bid under will they come back with a counter?

Few pics and term sheet from refinance.

&amp;#x200B;

Purchased for 132k direct from seller home was in preforeclosure. 

&amp;#x200B;

132k and I gave 8% down payment around 11k and 5k closing costs total investment 16k. I asked for 45k in rehab but only spent 36k(9k surplus). My holding costs were 1 mortgage payment about 1250 and around 400 in utility bills but lets say 2000 in holding costs for the trolls. Total invested after 60 days of ownership was 11k+5k+2k=18k and I had 9k leftover from rehab so 18k-9k=9k total capital invested. 

At refinance I'm receiving 13k cash back so I'll have 100% of my investment back within 8 months of purchase. In the last 6 months I've collected about 4800 in cash flow on this property. My mortgage will be 1900 with a rent of 3100 but I expect my cashflow to be around 800 a month.

Nothing out of the ordinary on this deal. It took around 3 months to convince the seller to go through with it he's an alcoholic and would cancel the deal one day then say yes a few days later.

I have no debt besides the house to which I put down 5% only for the down payment and have an interest rate of 2.85% (god bless that dip).

4074,realestateinvesting,Worst thing to happen to my tenants. One dies days before Christmas... Family is struggling. Searching for advice.," 

I've been landlording for 5 years and had several challenges arise but this is the first time a tenant has died.

Long story short: House is paid for. I rent it out. Things go well first year. Covid happens and I decide to not raise rent on any of my rentals for 2 years because times are hard for everyone. The tenants at said house start to struggle and lose their employment during Covid. I start a payment plan each month and they are able to pay the rent over across 3 fees spread out over each month. They are living paycheck to paycheck.

They suddenly are really late and miss their promise to pay. I investigate and find out the one of the tenants changes job and they are paid on different weeks. I wait an extra week and they pay everything and things return to normal.

2 months later (now, days before Christmas) car wreck. Husband dies and other family in critical care...

I tell them not to worry as they try to find funds for burial. I'll work with them on their rent. I really don't think they will be able pay in the future since the major ""bread winner"" has passed. I have a plan on what to do but I'm reaching out to all of y'all to see what you would do in my situation.

What do you do?

The house is paid for. Taxes and insurance continues to increase. Their are occasional issues with this house and I've already thrown away 8 months profit replacing HVAC and various appliance that wore out this year (it was expected). I'm financially okay, but have other plans for this money and this is a business, but I am by no means going to evict a single mother and her kids after losing their father just before Christmas. These tenants have rented from me for about 3 years. That's some of the background."

23 y/o have $78.5K left on a mortgage for a house I guess is worth about $160K at 3.25%. I paid $175.5K for the house in March’22 - house prices have dropped in my area since.

I’m wanting to pay the house off asap while maintaining a 20% investment rate into my 401k. I then want to get a new mortgage on a property with more land and less neighbors. I estimate if I pay the mortgage aggressively I can pay the house in 7-9 years.

I also estimate I can rent the place out for $1500-$1700/month. This is likely to increase in the coming years I’m sure. With no mortgage, maintenance (300/month), property taxes/insurance (170), income taxes (375-425), 10% vacancy estimate (150-170), and a property manager (150-170) I’m looking at a net $355-$465 net every month. Are these estimates reasonable?? I’m wondering if this margin is too thin if my estimates are reasonable. If too thin of a margin I may just sell the place at some point and use that cash as a down payment on my next property. 

So, someone convince me this is a bad idea. If this is a bad idea I’d like to know before I commit lol.

The two single family units were purchased in the 50-60k range and the duplex in the 95k range. These were all purchased with loans and are  not the highest of quality properties but pretty good cash flowing. 

We’re now trying to decide where to go from here. 

Option 1: One option is to continue to buy cheap cost, high cash flowing properties.. try to buy 1-2 properties a year

Option 2: Second option is to buy a little more expensive single units.. in the 100k-150k range. May need to wait a little longer till we have the cash saved up to buy this property but could be a better quality property

Option 3: Try to get another 2-4 unit property. Would likely be in 150k-250k and may need to wait to have downpayment for it

Would love any recommendations people have as we’re not sure. Should we optimize for cash flow and doors, or buy fewer better quality properties / more multi family units?"

1. How do property management companies that own large amounts of units (closed communities for example) deal with this? Surely they're not taking this much risk when they own hundreds if not thousands of units. Do they have some sort of bypass to the eviction process?
2. When I lived in a house with my college roommates we signed a contract but we always paid rent in cash and never got receipts. Is this normal? Are there any downsides to this?
3. If I make a verbal with a renter to be paid in cash without a written contract wouldn't that make it easier to evict? If they decide to stop paying wouldn't I be able to just change the locks and they would have no evidence that I ever rented to them?"

She is not getting listed on BK so she is clear from that. Only issue is I’m only income for both of us. She is stay at home mom. So what are our chances of getting a mortgage and is it even possible to get one WHILE waiting to file or even right after filing?"

Got financing and was waiting for the appraisal to come back for final closing to be approved. We had to extend the contract twice to try and wait out the appraiser since they were too busy at the time, and finally was able to get him out there in early April with a projected close of mid April.

Have it in writing about a week before closing from the appraiser that he was able to get to the property, start the report, and would have the appraisal complete before the close date. And then nothing. No response to phone calls, texts, emails, mail. The financing couldn’t get ahold of him, nor could I or my realtor.

All in all I lost about $20k in EMD, appraisal cost and inspection costs, plus a whole lot of time and headaches, and the investment as a whole.

Is it worth a lawsuit or does this just happen? Because if so and there’s no repercussions then I feel like I need to be a property appraiser."

4132,realestateinvesting,Section 8?,"This might not the place for this, but long story short, I am in the need to move out of my primary in next several months.  I got a great mortgage on it (2.5%) just a little over a year ago so I have no desire to sell it yet.  Even though it's already appreciated a little, it's a high demand area that will keep going up over time, 99% sure on that.  

So I decided to rent it out.  

I got an inquiring renter already, that wants to live there 3+ years..but she has to go through this section 8 approval (she is nice, her kids are nice, but still) which essentially is government assistance.  They limit her to just under what I was hoping for ($2,400)..and also would have to add some utilities in there to keep her approved...

So basically, I would run about break-even all said in done after utilities and everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this wise to do?  I know making cash flow is a major goal of renting out your property, but I figured, what is that \~$100/month going to do for me a ton anyways?  Where as $2,300/month, covering my mortgage, utilities, and a tiny bit of wiggle room for other surprises..

&amp;#x200B;

The other pro I see of it, is that the government is almost guaranteeing that this rent will be paid, through them.  But I'm still a bit weary about it, or hesitant.  Because, it's a little under asking, and there might be other renters potentially that apply?

&amp;#x200B;

I could see myself finding a 'better' renter, who will pay the asking amount, have a bit better background/history with bills...But, doubt they will be staying as long.

4136,realestateinvesting,Should I buy a single family home?,"Hi there I am in desperate need for advice. 

A little context about me, I am a 21 year old male who currently has about $11,000 saved up, with $1,500 in my 401k as well. I live home with my parents while going to a local community college while working full time as a banker. I have a car loan of $10,000 and work full time. I currently save a net total of around $1,400-$1,700 per month with an additional of $400 added to my 401k so I'm saving close to $2,000 per month.

My best friend and business partner has recently discovered a single family home on the market, (we're both realtors, on side) going for $129,000 he was able to convince the sellers to go down to $117,000, all in all with utilities and insurance the home will be looking at around $1,600 per month we're looking to split the cost where each of us will pay $800 with food, etc, I expect to pay around $1,200 per month. 

My parter also has a girlfriend of 5 months who's looking to move in and pay $600 per month which should leave me with $900 worth of expenses and leave me with around $500 left in my pocket vs the $1400-$1700 before. We think we could find a second roommate or couple to rent out the upper part as its rather large with a few rooms for around $1000 on the low end. This in turn should give me close to $1000 in my pocket while building equity. In the future we plan on hoping to another property and rent out the entire property, this is highest potential of course. Worst case I suppose his girlfriend doesn’t pay, we struggle to get a second roommate in, and we have much more capital expenditures than anticipated, like broken water heater or broken shower consistently.

With interest rates being the way they are now and with it being a sellers market do you think I should invest, save and wait, or what? If I decide to wait 1 year where I anticipate more homes on market and lower interest rates I will have a little over $30,000 saved up excluding my 401k due to bonuses and such with 401k I will be close to 35k at the age of 22! but I will have no equity :(

Please share your thoughts and ideas as I am at a crossroads. Also finances aside I know I will have more fun. I want to be independent and not waste my youth working all the time. (but I also have chill lenient parents so ughhh lol) both sound fine, even if i take the whole year off I can nearly survive a year if I decide to move out and shit hits the fan, I don't want shit to hit the fan of course...nasty"

4139,realestateinvesting,What kind of property is it better to invest to generate income?,"Hello everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

I need some advice from investors or realtors. I am thinking of investing in the real estate market. I do know how people make money from it. I don’t want to play around figuring out how the Bitcoin market is going to act in the future. Besides, people will always need a roof over their heads, and the world’s population is constantly growing. As you may already know, we’ve recently passed the number of 8 billion people on our planet.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I decided that the real estate niche was the best bet for me. Now, I have gathered some money and feel ready to start. It’s definitely not enough for a mansion. Nonetheless, I can afford a one-bedroom apartment in my hometown in Florida or invest some cash into the getaway lodge.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know which option to go for. That’s why I’ve decided to post here and consider my pros and cons. Maybe you can share some good points too.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve also read some materials about investing in the real estate market on the [Money Under 30](https://www.moneyunder30.com/) webpage. They have some excellent tips, even though I no longer fit into this age range.

&amp;#x200B;

Many friends of mine have purchased a property on the shoreside to sublet it for tourists. But, from their experience, I’ve heard that they can generate income only during the tourist season. Besides, some tourists aren’t that nice and leave those houses in a mess. One of my friends had to renovate the whole house after he hosted a group of surfers. Even the damage deposit couldn’t cover all the costs. It sounds terrifying to me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I thought of buying a one-bedroom apartment or a small studio to sublet to young adults. I need to find good tenants ready to pay rent in the long run. Do you think it’s possible to make money this way? I also thought of furnishing that apartment with some furniture in the garage to charge the tenants a bit more. It’s in good condition, and they can rent a “party furnished” apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any other suggestions, please feel free to share. It would be interesting to hear your thoughts."

4147,realestateinvesting,Rate my Deal,"Hey Guys, 

I'm in contract on a 4 unit in Dayton Ohio and would like to get your feedback. With 5k miscellaneous aesthetic repairs (might be more after I get inspection report) I'm looking at a CoC of 8.75%. Without the 5k repairs CoC is 9.5%. This is having included 5% of rent a month for vacancy, 5% for maintenance, 5% for capital expenditures,  8% for management fees. However, the property manager recommended to me by my agent charges a full months rent for placing/replacing a tenant, and currently two units are vacant, so its really slightly less CoC when you consider that.

According to my agent, the property was appraised for \~10% more when it got appraised for the previous buyer who could not get financing. The property appraisal wasn't high enough for the lender to agree to the financing for the previous buyer, as he was trying to get the loan with no down. So if this is true, this is good because I'm ""buying equity"" right from the start. 

As you might have guessed, the downside is that it's not a good area. I have never been there but according to quick google searches about crime statistics and the crime grade, it is a high crime area. 

My thinking is: The success/failure of this investment relies solely on the quality and competence of the property manager I work with, which at this point I'm going only based on recommendation.

What are your thoughts on everything I mentioned?

And if I do end up going with the deal, should I be concerned about the property managers practice of charging a placement/replacement fee of first months rent?"

B) put 20% down to avoid PMI

C) am I doing this wrong/what would you suggest I do in my current situation?"

I have no idea what to expect during tax time. Is it a problem if we haven't had any renters? We are doing monthly rentals so there's a high likelihood that it won't start renting till at least January. Which means that we will not have had any renters during 2022. Is that a problem?

Do we need to at least rent the place a certain amount of time for it to qualify for any tax benefits? This is Florida.

4162,realestateinvesting,Looking for Critique(s),"Good afternoon all,

   Just wanted to get some opinions from the RE investors. Relevant info:

#1. I do not currently own my own residence
#2. Current investments are 100k in taxable brokerage account and 150k in 401k.
#3. I am currently in a ""shared living"" arrangement so my total monthly expenses are low. Like 500/mo total.
#4. Stable, decent paying job (70kyr.)

My plan is to form an LLC and buy a sfh in a nearby town and rent it out for 1-2yrs, eventually dissolving the LLC and making the property my primary residence. I don't really want to go in to RE investing for the long haul, but I like the idea of having my mortgage offset by rental income for a year or two. That way I can save a bit more in my 401k by not having to pay the utilities and mortgage until I theoretically move in. If I were to go the traditional route and move in to a primary residence my monthly expense would double, at least. 

 Ideally, Id like to have the paydown process started by the tenent and save enough to either pay off the morgtage early or invest in equities. 

One major concern I have is legal issues, i.e. being sued and having my brokerage account  placed in the crosshairs of a savy attorney. I know LLC's are supposed to help with that concern if done correctly, but I would be going with a single member llc and I am weary of the protections this provides.  I'm sure I'm missing some other issues, but that is why I figured I'd post and get some opinions/criticism.

4182,realestateinvesting,HELOC or Cash Out Refi on home in LLC?,"Hi Reddit, 

I am looking at doing my first all-cash BRRRR in the next couple of months here, and plan on using an LLC structure to purchase. 

Let's assume the following scenario:

\- $100k purchase price  
\- $25k rehab  
\- $150k ARV 

I want to tap into the $150k equity here and roll it into the next property, so my question is: What's the best way to do that **when the home is owned in a LLC**? Am I right to assume that I cannot refi and get a conventional 30-year mortgage because it's considered a ""business""?  If I can't get a mortgage, can I get a HELOC with a 30-year repayment structure and what are the general requirements for this? 

I do understand I can only get 70-80% LTV no matter what method I use. 

Any and all help is greatly appreciated."

I’m planning to buy their house (2 family) and fix it up and keep it in the family as a rental property. I have experience managing and owning rentals but need some advice. The house has a significant amount of deferred maintenance, including needing a new roof, siding, driveway and much more. I would be buying it way under market value and putting my own cash into fixing it up. Is there any advantage to buying the house first and then doing the work? Or would it be better to fix it first and then buy it? 

I’m thinking it’s beneficial to be the owner and then do the repairs as I can depreciate the improvements on my taxes over time. On the other hand, if I fix it up first and then buy it it would appraise for a lot more and I could potentially pull some cash out right away to build them a new house on my land…looking for advise. 

More about the property: the mortgage plus all their debts could be paid off with ~200k. It’s easily with 400k with no improvements and in the as is condition. It has an in-law apartment that generates ~30k/year as an Airbnb before expenses and taxes. They will continue living in the property for at least two years while I build them a home.

4188,realestateinvesting,What should I do with the assests I have,[removed]
4189,realestateinvesting,$1.5 million commercial building for very little out of pocket.,"Interesting deal on the hook, my first foray into commercial RE.

TL;DR: Analyzing this deal, then extrapolating if I did this same deal ten times, to create $5mm.

I would greatly appreciate feedback from experienced CRE investors. My whole goal is to create a scalable, sustainable, and safe business model in CRE for myself, but more importantly any investors or partners. 

I am just about to start DD, so the info on the below deal will not be 100% complete, but it's where I are in the process currently.

My RE experience is with SFR and small multi BRRRRs, wholesales, flips, rentals since 2009, but as a business the last 5 years. My first thought on 100% financed deals is: Danger! But buying at a discount, thoughtful structuring, liquidity, and upside potential can turn overleverage into responsible leverage, like with flips and the BRRRR strategy I have done a bunch.

Back to the Deal:

List Price 1.9mm, agreed on 1.5mm

Financing: Bank 75%, Seller 25% carryback.

Commercial strip mall, 9 units, fully occupied. No 1 tenant is more than 20% of the sqft. MSA is a decent, growing, neighborhood is C class (busy street connecting residential to industrial, not much around) B- building (1990s build). 

Seller carry-back loan terms: 6.5% interest only payments, 5 year balloon, and first 6 months no payments after closing (to help build a reserve fund for capex and/or vacancy).

NOI for 2022: **114k** with some vacancy.

NOI for 2023 (my estimate): 129k

DSCR including the seller carry: \~1.03

DSCR w/o seller carry: \~1.28

Year 1 Cashflow: \~$3,400 (very low,  I know, read on)

.

About the Seller: 2nd owner of property, owned for 10 years (purchased with windfall $), moved out of state, only CRE property they own, on the market almost 1 year. 

**Cons** of this deal:

1. Obvious one first: High leverage / low year 1 cashflow / Vacancy Risk:  I am mitigating some risk by getting 6 months no payments for the seller-carry loan for reserve account build-up (\~$12k), also getting 1 month rent before bank payment is due (\~$8,500). 1st 6 months of ownership I should have \~$22k in reserves just from the property itself. I don't want to feed this property, but do have 500k liquid atm, if I need to feed over the short term. 
2. Not my local market, so I don't have the same confidence, but willing to learn before earnest money goes hard. Also I'll be vetting this deal pretty hard during DD, looking for any and all red flags. I'd rather pass up a deal then get locked into bad deal. 
3. One big ""office"" tenant (occupying 15% of building) will be leaving this August. Vacancy likely but opportunity to increase rent rate on a new lease too. Won't be another big tenant lease renewal until 03/24 then 11/24 (both OG tenants tho, decent likelihood of renewal and rent bumps). 

Pros of this deal:

1. Very little $ out of pocket so I am not risking much capital initially.
2. Upside potential = NOI has room to grow, i.e. rent raises, add signage/billboard for high traffic area (20k cars/day), more room to build on lot. 
3. Tenant mix is good, few long term tenants in place, motivated seller.
4. Debt reduction of \~ 19k/yr avg thru 5 years, 96k total.
5. Plan is to have the NOI increased and stabilized, leading to a value of \~$2mm by year 4. This will create \~500k in equity which will be kept in the property when I refi at year 4 or 5. New bank loan would be for 1.5mm and hopefully interest rates will be lower by then,  helping out cashflow even more. 
6. Improved mgmt / less vacancy: **IF** I can manage the property better and reduce vacancy 5% it could be another 10k in cashflow / yr. Get vacancy down to 0%, an extra 20k cashflow / yr. I'm expecting 10% vacancy, but it would be icing on the cake if I had 0% for a couple years.

&amp;#x200B;

As this deal stands, I believe it to be a solid base hit without much capital invested and without factoring in the upside.

After I take over, manage better, reduce vacancy, increase rents, pursue any other value add strategies I can think of to boost NOI, I see the potential to create up to 500k in equity within 5 years on this deal, just by pulling a few levers. 

I always ask myself if I would do this deal, would I do 10 more just like it. Right now, my answer is yes, but I want my fellow redditors to ask questions and poke holes (thoughtfully if possible ha) because I am sure I have lots of blind spots.

If I did 10 deals like the one above, estimates:

Total cash outlay: \~150k (mine or investors)

Debt Reduction: \~15,000$/mo OR \~$190k/yr

Year 1 Net Cash Flow: \~$2,800/mo &amp; \~%34k/yr (not much)

Potential Equity Creation: \~$5,000,000 over 5 years. 

Assuming all 10 deals were PP of 1.5mm. I might be getting a little ahead of myself, but I envision doing deals into the 3 and 5 mm range as I gain experience, contacts, confidence, etc. so that $5mm could be amplified as well, just depending on how each property shakes out.

If you have made it this far, I thank you in advance just for sticking around. Please feel free to leave a comment about:

1. Examples of deals you have done like this and how they turned out
2. Advice based off experience you have gained over the years
3. Any flaws in my logic, numbers, or assumptions.

1. How hard it will be or how unlikely my goals are to be accomplished
2. Something you don't have experience with personally

4198,realestateinvesting,REI in Chicago not the move?,"Tried looking through all the posts about Chicago but I just got confused. I've been on the hunt for a while and have been weighing my options because REI in Chicago does seem risky but I'm not planning on moving anywhere anytime soon and I plan on holding for 5+ years. I'm doing it for some cash flow, not expecting an extra 10k a year or anything, but SOME would be nice.

I'm not set on this place and I'm just using it as an example. I found a place in River North with asking as $250k and a decent HOA under $400, but the property tax varies depending on what site I use from $5k-$6k annually. I usually calculate with the higher end because it's more realistic. The place is currently being rented for the next year so I have extra time to find a new renter. The place is currently being rented out for $2100 and the parking spot to someone else for $200.

The issue I'm having is figuring out how much I could rent it out for. I refuse to buy anything where I'd have to pay out of pocket because that just defeats the entire purpose...but I'm not sure how much other places are renting for or if anyone would even be willing to rent for that much. 

If I'm calculating correctly my monthly mortgage would be about $1960-$2k (depending on down payment and interest) so assuming I could continue to find someone willing to pay $2100 + parking I think it would be a win. 

Thoughts? Am I calculating this right? Realistically with the way things are right now, how many people are willing to pay above $2k?"

We all get that properties going on sale represents a good buying opportunity. 

For some risk takers, this means looking beyond the price of the home, and taking on a loan that is at the edge of what they find comfortable, with plans on refinancing in a couple years which will seal the deal on their investment. It’s as if they go hand in hand. 

If you bet on rates lowering and are correct, a refinancing opportunity stands to make the initial investment all the more lucrative."
4205,realestateinvesting,⭕IS IT WORTH BUYING A RESALE PROPERTY? | By Resaleadvisor.com,[removed]
4206,realestateinvesting,Seller Financed House,"So I found this house I want.  The owner has several rental properties, many. Alot.  They were getting this one ready to rent.  New plumbing all currently fine.  New drywall most is fine. New wiring for several 20 Amp circuits not fine.

They took too long maybe that is how to say it putting up the drywall after running the new circuits so the wiring was just there the romex I mean.  And you can probably guess what happened.  Yep someone stole it.  It was an easy thing to do.

The house is not in a bad neighborhood.  It is in a small town in another state.  I actually want to relocate to this town.  I am putting my primary residence up for sale next week with an agent which is in another state.

So...  I called about this house and the owner wants to sell.

I can pay cash no problem or  I can let the owner finance it.  Basically 3000 down.  Then finance 20k at zero percent interest.  Yes zero. They will do 400 or 500 a month up to me.  I know about imputed interest but that is on them.

I want to buy it get the electrical (I can do this myself) and drywall fixed(i will pay someone) then live in it while I have my primary residence up for Sale.  When my primary sells I can find a much nicer house in the area and then rent this one out.

It seems better to owner finance it for two reasons.

1.) I have a hysa account earning 4% apr.  It may go up with the new fed rate hike it may not.  4% of 20k is 67$ a month.  So I get 67$ a month every month and use it towards the $400 payment.

2.) I get to keep the 20k in the bank.

Am I missing any reason not to owner finance?

So they have daily customers but it’s not super high volume.  Think 10’s of customers using the front door vs 100’s or 1000’s daily.    The porch is 23’ wide x 9’ deep and all foot traffic is really in the center 20% of the porch.  It has that thin “1980 style porch carpet” on it, but it’s really worn with some holes in it.  It needs to be removed and replaced.

I was thinking of replacing it with those outdoor carpet tiles so that if the foot traffic path in the center of the porch gets worn in the future I can replace that section without replacing the entire 400 sqft.

I found the following 2’x2’ res/commercial tiles at a big box but was looking for a sanity check from my fellow investors if I’m about to make a big mistake or something, especially if there’s a known ideal product for this type of application.  Of all my properties this is my first carpeted porch.  Because it’s in a historic district it’s not on the table to change the porch covering type or color without a lot of red tape, so I’m wanting to replace dark gray carpet with new dark gray carpet.

I recently converted my garage to an ADU and it has been a massive success. I finished it for around $45k and it rents out at $1900. 

Because it has been such a good project I’m considering adding a second adu, a JADU, directly on top of the garage. It would be 480 square feet. Because roof would need to be taken off and put back on additional structural support, etc. I’d assume the project would run closer to $100k. 

If I get the same rent amount ($1900), I would cover the cost of financing (10 year loan) and then some.

We have 100k in cash and 200k in equity on our current home.  I'm looking for ways to analyze this decision from a math/spreadsheet perspective. 

If I rent my current home out, I could cashflow $500/month. And put the 100K cash down on the new home.

I could sell our current home and put 100k down (30%) on two smaller rental homes and still only cashflow $500/month ($250 each).  Use the same 100k current cash on the new home.

Or, sell the current home, put 200k down on the new home, which would lower my mortgage, and put 100k down on a rental which would cashflow $250/mo, but my main residence would be slightly lower monthly (still not at low as it is now tho.).

4226,realestateinvesting,$1 million cash to invest in Multi-Family,"Hey guys, I’m a 32M living in Northern California with income of $350k. I have 3 SFH that are paid off worth $1.2million. 

I know that I missed the boat on refi’s at crazy low rates and high valuations but wanted more insight into the potential of selling these homes in the future and investing into multifamily.

By selling these homes, I will have a 30% down for a $3.5-$4million apartment complex.

My concern is that I have not dealt with a commercial note before. From my knowledge, a lot of these commercial notes have a 25 year amortization and 10 year term. I’m afraid that at the end of the 10 year term I will be stuck with a huge ballon payment with hardly a dent to the principal because of the amortization schedule. I know that people refinance at the end of the term but wanted to figure how others have dealt with this?Thanks"
4227,realestateinvesting,Second homes on islands/exotic places,"I was wondering if anyone has actively sought out a luxury place as a second home/vacation house such as Caribbean when values were stagnant or expected to decline. Basically if many people think housing will decrease in value because rates are going up (remain high), are you looking or expecting a good deal on a place you’d dream of buying in, such as Bahamas or Bermuda?

I was also curious if anyone knows how home prices did at some of these super luxurious places during 2006-2009, or if you have any anecdotal stories to share."
4228,realestateinvesting,Question on loan modifications and commercial loan products,"I am looking to start purchasing pure investments - strictly 2-4 unit residential multi-families.

I started to sit down with commercial loan officers and here's what they told me:

1. For these type of products, expect to put down at least 25-30% down payment minimum
2. Interest rates in my area (new england area) are in the mid 6s 
3. All products are adjustable and NOT fixed, fixed is not possible
4. Loan modifications are possible and seem to basically be a refinance with a much lower barrier to entry (no appraisal, no underwriting) 
5. As the relationship grows, flexibility on terms may grow (depends on bank)

My question is - does this seem to jibe with those who are doing deals around New England? And more specifically, how do loan modifications work in practice? If I were to purchase a 10/1 and rates come down in 3 years, I could do a modification and then lock in a lower rate for another 10-30 yr period until it is paid in full? Does this require points or other fees typically?"
4229,realestateinvesting,Getting a 2nd loan when first property isn’t income producing,"I have an opportunity to purchase a condo from a family member. The condo would be sold at an incredibly reasonable price to the point I  could hypothetically  turn around and sell it for a slight profit. However, I would want to hold it and rent it. However with the condo HOA fee plus the mortgage, I would not be positive. I would losing $200-$300 a month. If this is the case and I wish to get another 2nd investment property… could I still take loan out for the second investment property, even though this would be potentially losing money every month? I thought I read banks won’t loan for another investment if the first isn’t netting profit.

2. I’m a broke college student should I focus on increasing my income first before I worry about real estate investing? (Credit score is excellent)

3. I’m piggy backing off of question #2: do you need money to make money as a real estate investor?

When I say invest in real estate I don’t mean the big beautiful mansions in Florida or California. I’m more interested in those three story apartment buildings I see in my neighborhood. 

My ultimate goal for wanting to invest in real estate is to build wealth and use the money to buy a condo in one of my favorite city.

I am buying a home which is a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom home. The appraisal report came back and the appraiser used 3 comps all 3 beds 1 bathrooms that sold recently. 

The appraisal came back higher than we needed for financing still but I was a bit surprised this is what they decided to compare the home too. There were clearly other 4 bed 2 bath homes that I saw were sold in the last 3 months on Zillow.

Is there a benefit to appeal or it doesn’t matter since it appraised for what I needed it too regardless.

Just curious what you all would do.

4240,realestateinvesting,Need a reality check - building a cottage on inherited property.,"Before I dive into this deeper, I wanted to get an honest opinion from fellow redditors who have experience in this.

I am about to inherit an acre of land close to Muskoka cottage country. The only thing I know about this land is there is hydro on the property line and that the road is maintained year round.

My first and only thought was to build a cabin that my family and I could use and for short term / aribnb rentals. Comparable, 800-1000ft cottages sold in the area between 550K-650K.

My question is -- what are some of the things to consider before I start diving deeper into this? What is an avg cost per sq ft to build a winterized cottage in the cottage country now adays? Also, I'd need a septic tank and a well dug -- what are the costs associated with that?

4246,realestateinvesting,Do you believe there is a real estate bubble?,"TL;DR: If you believe there is a real estate bubble that will be popping, how did you draw that conclusion? 

To preface, my entire career has been built off both finance &amp; real estate so please feel free to hit me with everything ya got:

Two weeks ago, Fed Chair Powell stated that we are on the back end of the US ‘housing bubble.’ Although a market correction is happening, I am hesitant to put any stock into talks of a bubble of any sort. Over the past 2 years, we saw rates fall to historically low levels and house prices blast off to the moon to make up for the difference. These house prices became so elevated that the tales of record sales and house prices attracted national attention making everyone want in on the action. The drastic increase in demand left many hungry to buy but the supply simply wasn’t and still isn’t there. As many hunker down through the recessionary period, many buyers will be avidly awaiting their time to finally enter the market- with much lower rates and potentially 2 years of savings to burn.

As prices pull back, I worry reasonable house prices aren’t going to come in time.. The Federal Reserve will finish kicking back inflation and ripping the padding from corporations earnings reports and we’ll be left looking at listings saying ‘that’s it?’ Before we know it, the market will be flush with cash and sellers will once again have the ball in their court. It breaks my heart to see younger generations being paid less with higher costs of living when compared to earlier generations- now they’re being denied the chance to own a home, too? Do you trust the Federal Reserve, or the general public, to pull prices back to earth? If so, on what grounds do you draw that conclusion?"

However, the more that I research RE investing, the more I feel like the pros normally target cheaper houses that are under 100k or only slightly above. This obviously makes more sense when looking at things like the 1% rule and CoC.

My question is whether we should stick with our original thesis of a \~$250k property in Charlotte or if it makes more sense to try and find 2 properties at \~$125k elsewhere in the state.

We really like Charlotte because of the family ties and the macro factors, but I'm concerned that starting with a more expensive property in an appreciation market will give us less return and slow us down from obtaining more properties.

All advice is appreciated!"

We are paying them a third of the purchase price over the course of 15 years.  We are currently looking at how to structure our ownership and payments.  Orginally the plan was that we'd own/inherit 2/3 of the home and my brother would inherit 1/3.  We will share inheritance of this house with my brother in law (he's OK with us buying into his share).  Would you structure the contract so that 

1. Upon eventual sale of the home, I receive 50% plus the added percentage that I've paid into at that point.  (Each year of those 15 years, I'm buying 2.22% more equity)

2.  Set a fixed return ~7% of the dollars I've paid into at that point, then split 50/50 with brother in law.  

With option one, I'd benefit from appreciation more.  With option two, the math is simple and would give me a fixed return.  I feel that 7% is fair considering the current mortgage rates and I know I could make more than that landlording (have two rentals currently).

4294,realestateinvesting,Excellent revenue but tenant is high risk - how to structure a cash offer?,"Cheap mobile on its own lot for 20k. The lot alone is worth 18k. Surprisingly good location. Trailer is in OK shape but definitely needs renovating. Pays 800/mo rent as is and tenant is on gov assistance so rent is assured. Very good cash flow for the price. Not looking for appreciation, only cash flow.

BUT tenant is obviously the reason it hasn't sold - strong likelihood of addiction issues and is likely to be attracting undesirables to the unit.

Owner is highly motivated to sell but how would you structure this offer? I would love to buy it empty but the low price is because owner doesnt want to deal with the tenant. Worse, there is NO lease in place, only a verbal agreement.

Residential Tenant Act (Alberta) says I can give 1 yr notice to vacate on the grounds of major renovation, just unsure how many issues a high risk tenant who knows she's going to be evicted in a year is likely to cause. Owner says she has been 'no trouble', but Im taking that with a wink.

This deal has big red flags but the potential is for 900/mo out of a cash deal of 20k - more than 50% ROI. Very tempting.

How would you write it? Or would you walk away? Im not a noob, Ive had these types of tenants before but never with this kind of potential upside on a unit."

4317,realestateinvesting,Help me analyze this deal,"&amp;#x200B;

This is my first investment property and i could really use you guys' help analyzing this potential 4 plex purchase. 

Purchase Price: 116,000.00

Investment Property Interest rate 8%

Rental Income: 2100/ Month. 

Property Taxes: 1400/Year

Insurance: 800/Year

Trash, Gas Heat, Water Sewer: Approximately 500/Month.

Vacancy- 5%

Management Fee- 10%

Quick Calculation and looks like the property will cashflow 350 a month. Cap rate of 10.6 an Cash on Cash return of 16%

Property is in a economically depressed area and i do expect value appreciation to lag that of nationwide average. Property has old hardwood floors that would need to be replace in the event of vacancy.  I would probably have to replace the radiator heat with central AC in the future. 

Does this potential rate look good to you guys?"

4322,realestateinvesting,Struggling to follow Real Estate Investor guru math - need help,"I see some awesome numbers thrown at me but cannot replicate those awesome numbers in my own calculations, so need some help. For context: https://www.reddit.com/r/REBubble/comments/zl10c9/70k_per_year_on_airbnb_and_now_an_airbnb_course/j04zbmh/?depth=9&amp;context=8 (or https://archive.ph/cmSPs)

If a Real Estate Investor has $1.1MM worth of real estate ($500K equity) that yields $60K a year pretax:

1. Doesn't that mean, ignoring the leverage, the ROI is 6%? (60000/1000000)
2. Doesn't that mean, including the leverage, the ROI is 12%? (60000/500000)
3. There's a claim that `cash on cash return is literally 21%` (https://www.reddit.com/r/REBubble/comments/zl10c9/comment/j06jas7/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) - I cannot find a way to replicate that 21% return - how would one arrive at that?
4. Claims of `tax savings that are very unique to real estate` (https://www.reddit.com/r/REBubble/comments/zl10c9/comment/j050fxd/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) were made - arn't these just depreciation and writeoffs for expenses any business has already?

I do understand that for the average American who doesn't run a profitable business, Real Estate is a great way to build a $1.1MM portfolio fueled by pretty cheap single digit loans backed and funded by the U.S. Govt, but the guru math evades me and I don't want to miss out on opportunities where I make double digit returns

Likely rent out between $2300-$2500/mo. PITI around $2k/mo

Down payment - $95k + closing costs

$10k rehab costs

NOI between $30,639 and $33,039 including management but not a repair/maintenance line item. 

Coc return looking like \~3.5% to 4.7%. Pretty thin. Wildcard if rates drop in the future, refinance can give better cash return.

I can get a 4.5% risk free return in a 6 month treasury. So not doing it for the cashflow, but rather the unrealized portion of principal paydown, appreciation and tax deduction after depreciation.

Any thoughts on this? What is your opinion? The rental looks like a solid rental, good layout, low maintenance type of construction, good neighborhood, steady demand in my area for good housing.

4348,realestateinvesting,Advice on a possible loss vs long term hold,"Without really understanding what I was doing I purchased my first condo (DC MD metropolitan area) back in 2007 just before the crash. I purchased for 285,000 and then a year later the value had dropped to 215,000. When I moved out, I put a renter in the unit and refinanced. Since that time the rent has fluctuated while the condo fees have gone up. Overall it has been a break even property, but with the fees rising and constant maintenance it will be in the red eventually. Once the mortgage is paid off it would be nice to have a small amount of passive income, even if some of it gets eaten by management fees and maintenance. But that’s going to be awhile about 20 years, and I don’t know how this works as the property slowly succumbs to wear and tear. I have 187,000 left on the mortgage, but and local realities realtors are quoting me 240,000 gross as the current sale value. 

Do I continue to hold? Or do I take a loss? Do put money into it and I try to ABNB it?  I know that it has to be my decision, but just need to talk through it. I’m looking for advice, and perspective from people with experience. I am not a property investor, but kind of fell into this."

I would like to get to the point where I have rentals and flips going at the same time, but what's the best advice you can give a person trying to get into it in the beginning with a little bit of a nest egg in the bank?

My main idea is flipping a couple houses til I can get a couple rentals going on the side for passive income and then ramping up the flip side. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!"

4359,realestateinvesting,Deal analysis - need advice,"Hey all,

I'm looking at purchasing a new condo/apartment to rent. I currently have a few properties, all paid off. I am looking to purchase this property with a mortgage (new for me except my primary - so cash flow is a concern of mine). Below are the numbers I've worked out. I do have a current apartment in the same neighborhood as this one. I purchased it about 18 months ago for 49k. The one I'm looking at is listed at 75k. Market rent in the area is 850 - 900. My current tenant for the 49k apartment is paying 750, but he's paying below market rate and will have a slight adjustment to 800 at renewal this year. I did previously post a few days ago about a previous property.

Numbers below:

|Home Value|75,000||
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent:|\~850||
|Vacancy: 5%|42.5||
|**Gross monthly operating income**|**807.5**||
|Repairs|80||
|Taxes|37||
|Insurance|22||
|HOA|119||
|**Monthly operating expenses**|**257.25**||
|Total Annual Operating Income|9,690||
|Total Annual Operating Expense|3,087||
|**Annual** **NOI**|**6,603**||
|Purchase price|75,000||
|Cap Rate|8.8%||
|Initial Investment (Down payment, closing)|25,000|Interest rate: 6.6|
|Monthly PI payment|359.00||
|Annual Debt Service|4,308||
|Total Monthly Cash Flow|191.25||
|Annual Cash Flow|2,295||
|COC return|9.18%||

As far as the property itself, it's in a decent area. Lower income, but overall feels safe when you are there. Upkeep of the properties is overall 6/10, it's not a country club, but it isn't run down or filthy. As far as increase in value, I'm not too sure what to predict. It certainly shouldn't drop too much, it may go down slightly with market shifts, but either way, I can just hold.

I'm willing to take a little bit more risk given my current portfolio is all cash based, no mortgages, debt.

Any thoughts are appreciated, Happy to answer any questions about things I may have missed. TIA."

New to real estate investing and feeling a little confused on options and avenues for financing - specifically refinancing a property.

In August I bought a SFH in OKC all cash ($200k). Property currently is occupied and monthly income is $1600. Cap rate for the property is estimated at about 6%.

I would like to leverage the equity in this property and purchase another home. I reached out to a lender that my realtor recommended and today got their rate sheet quote of 8% for 5 year fixed term on a 20 year amortization. As rates are likely going up on Wednesday, I feel a little under the gun to lock in.

This rate is higher than expected considering I own the property outright, stellar personal credit score and also have strong liquidity to personally cover the loan. I asked the lender about other lending product but was told this was the best available to me. The financing world is all a little foreign to me. Curious if anyone has any advice for what I should do in the situation if this is truly the best rate I will be able to get or if I should hold off on re-financing and just pocket the monthly rental income.

I have used classified ads, among other things, to set various hypothesis (price, etc.) of my business plan. However, this doesn’t tell me how strong the demand is (or if there is too much offer already), especially in this neighborhood. 

What info should I search and scrutinize?

4404,realestateinvesting,"with the rent so high right now, is it better to rent a apartment or rent house? what are some pros cons?","

I currently rent my uncle's condo, but now he wants to sell it. Since he is tired of paying yearly taxes and associates fees. I'm trying to look for apartments in my area but they're so high and sometimes looking on craigslist some houses for rent are so cheap but I feel like they're sketchy or scam. So I don't really trust those websites. I tried looking into low income housing but it's such a long waiting list. And even if lucky I find, it's probably in a bad neighborhood. Every apartment ask for 3x monthly rent income and previous pay stubs. I don't even make enough money and my mom barely makes anything since her health isn't in good condition. 

I guess the housing market is considered the seller market? Maybe even if my uncle's intention is to get the profit from selling, he won't gain much since the interest rate are high. Unless someone wants to buy for cash. The condo I'm living in right now has a lot of problems and we don't have a good realtionship anymore with him. He is causing too much problems since he doesn't want to fix anything. As a owner, it's his responsibility to fix stuff. But we pay for everything. My mom health isn't in good condition and it's like what am I suppose to do now. I'm so tired mentally. I can't even focus on my college right now. I thought of moving to another state but sighs it's so overwhelming. I don't have anyone to ask for help like guidance."

4406,realestateinvesting,I'm interested in acquiring a property. But how?,"Hi a little about me: I'm pretty new to the industry and have been  lurking and learning as best I can. I read a lot and have various other forms of investments as well. I'm by no means ""rich"" however I do work hard and would like to think myself responsible.

I purchased my first home in 2020 with 2.6%. Every month since my first payment I've paid an additional 250$ towards principal as Well as using a tax return to pay another $3k a year when I receive it in February. Yes, I get a tax return as I'm a single father of 3 with sole custody.

**To the point!** My home has appreciated quite a bit in last few years - almost doubling in price at its peak.  I'm thinking of taking a second mortgage on the house and getting a rental property near where I live (Houston area).

Is this the best way to go about this? Since I can't refinance the entire property as interest rates have risen so much since my purchase. 

Im looking to do it sooner rather than later as id like to leverage the equity while I have it in case housing does come down a bit. Ideally I'd like to pull the cash and let it sit I possibly 6m bond or high yield savings and use it once the market corrects itself some ( if it happens.) instead of buying on the way down.

I am currently a commercial loan underwriter so I have been able to underwrite a lot of real estate loans and have a pretty good idea of what metrics a property should be hitting, how it should cash flow, the research that needs to go into it, etc etc. This is where I have some questions that can't be answered from this job:

\-How much money should I shoot to save up for if I want to make another investment in about 2 years?

\-How do you guys find mentors? This is something I keep seeing everyone say and I want to work with investors even for free I just don't know how to find them.

First 6 months was great and it was cash flowing like a beast @ $3,500 month (that’s after mortgage and minimal expenses). Then they stopped paying and refused to work out a deal. I got the lawyers involved and we have been in litigation ever since.

Well they abandon the property and let their insurance laps due to nonpayment, though they renewed insurance for 2022. Now I have a burst pipe and loads of water damaged in my uninsured building as my own policy is only liability. I’m f*cked.

Anyway, I am doing some end of year investment property planning and am very intrigued about the real estate professional status. I would love to be able to deduct losses of non-passive income but I'm not sure I would qualify under the IRS guidelines.

Question 1 - Real Estate Professional Status: Are full time real estate agents/brokers able to use their agent/broker service hours towards ""qualified real estate professional status""?  Example: I work 40-50 hours per week transacting brokering commercial real estate deals, and likely averaging 5 to 10 hours per week towards my investment real estate properties. Do my broker hours count towards the professional status, or just the hours specifically working on my personal investments?

Question 2 - Cost Segregation: I have four residential investment properties between $300k and $500k in value ($200k to $400k in building value assuming $100k land value) that most have been owned for at least a couple of tax years. Should I consider doing cost segregation?  What are the cons of cost segregation that I should consider?

I entered the market at a sweet spot. It was the early stages of ""low inventory"" and the latter stages of ""record-low interest rates"". I bought in Indiana where property is relatively cheap in general and the markets aren't super hot. I bought just before property prices started skyrocketing and just before rates hit their floor. I also had the advantage of getting a VA loan so I paid 0% down with a 3.25% rate.

Now in 2022, my credit score is above 700. My property is worth 53% more than what I paid for it and I'm about to put that equity to use. I'm preparing to cash-out refinance and buy a rental property or two in a nearby city.

Ive gotten to know the tenant and I feel too guilty to do a huge increase to market value of $1200. Like to $1000 would be ok. But also under Alberta laws there can only be one increase per year. So if I didn’t increase to market prices the new landlord would be stuck at lower value for a year and that would also deter my asking price.

4450,realestateinvesting,Does it make sense for me to buy instead of renting?,"Hello all,

I'm analyzing whether it would be better to buy a multifamily house hack or rent for my last 3 years of service, and I'm looking for any insight/advice that you all may be able to provide into which may be the better option long term.

The analysis for renting is pretty simple - $1,150/mo BAH (military housing allowance), $800/mo estimated rental costs. This scenario would result in savings of roughly $350 per month, or $12,600 over the whole 36 month period.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the breakdown for buying a $295,000 triplex with a 0% down payment VA home loan -

* $295,000 purchase price, 0% down, assuming a 6.1% interest rate
* I will assume $14,750 (5%) for closing costs (to be conservative), and $4,700 for the VA loan funding fee. This comes to a total of $19,450 for out-of-pocket costs.
* I estimate $2,500 in monthly expenses for owning the property ($2,200 PITI + $300 utilities / misc)
* I estimate $2,000 in monthly rental income (I would live in the cheaper unit, and rent out the other two units)
* This results in a $500/mo housing cost, allowing for $650/mo of my BAH to be saved per month. To be ultra conservative, I'll say all of that money goes to property maintenance costs.

In conclusion, after 3 years of owning the triplex I would have roughly $10,800 in equity assuming minimum mortgage payments (still in the hole from out-of-pocket costs). Although this is slightly lower than what would be saved through renting, the analysis I provided on the triplex is pretty conservative and doesn't account for any potential asset appreciation or rent increases (which would probably be unfair to assume over a measly 3 year timeframe).

I understand that a 3 year time frame is short. I would not plan on selling the property after 3 years. However, a property manager may be required after I leave the service. I would like to get my foot in the door with real estate and I feel like a multifamily deal like this, or potentially buying a SFH and renting out extra rooms could be my ticket. After moving out of this property, I expect to cashflow around $200 per month (would set aside for maintenance). Another thing worth noting is that refinancing into a lower interest rate in the future could make these numbers a LOT better, although it is not guaranteed.

So what are your thoughts on this? Can buying be justified in my situation? I'm ready to take the next step in my financial journey, just not sure which one makes sense. Any input is appreciated, thank you."

Need urgent advise. Will try to make this as short as possible while including all pertinent details. My dad and step mom purchased a rental home that they ended up putting in my name in 2005. They were on the mortgage since their credit and interest rate were better and I on the deed. In 2014, they said they needed me to quitclaim the deed for the purposes of refinancing the property and it would be quitclaimed right back to me. Keep in mind, since then, I’ve been writing the property interest off on my taxes since then. Fast forward, she ended up leaving out of nowhere and obviously wants half of everything. I have raised my family in this house and paid the mortgage every month to my dad the last 17+ years, who then paid the mortgage out of his bank account. We only owe $120k on a $400-ish house. For the last year, I have been fixing the house up, whole kitchen remodel, flooring, etc to sell it. My dad said he only had to give her $100k and the rest is ours. He’s obviously too trusting to the point of idiocy and now she is coming at him saying I was only renter and that I should get NOTHING from the house. The quitclaim back to me was never recorded and it was obviously singed under false pretenses. She thinks she can kick me and my family out and get half and I’m not so sure a judge would totally agree. For whatever reason, there is no divorce lawyer involved and that’s not really my business, I’m wondering how I can protect my family and safeguard my interest in this house. Thank you to anyone who read this far. I don’t want anything I’m not entitled to, I just can’t let her do this to my family and our future. Thanks."

4488,realestateinvesting,"Advice needed: converting short term to long term rental: Dallas, Texas","What’s up guys, 

I run a very successful STR in Dallas, TX. Rental income is averaging 10-12k a month, with average net profit of $5k in the last 4 months. Low of $3k high of $7k. 

However, Dallas is close to passing legislation to ban them in residential and commercial areas. Likely in the next 3-6 months. 

I listed my home on Zillow for rent, and got a hit for $7k a month within 30 minutes of posting. Guy wants to rent for longer than a year as well. Monthly net profit will be $2,366, yearly $28,392.  

My COC return would be basically 28%, as I invested about $100k cash to purchase, renovate, furnish the place.

Holding costs not including utilities (he would pay all utilities) are about $4,634.

Would you guys recommend holding out and upping the rent on Zillow to see what I could get? And running it as an Airbnb as long as possible?

Or consider taking this offer/try to amend the rent with him to $8-9k a month. 

Lots of variables and options here. Only thing I don’t want is if they get banned, to have a huge influx of rentals hit the market and get caught holding the bag, with no tenant lined up.

As an avid outdoorsy kinda guy, I came across this site through an ad and actually ended up buying some land last night. It's a company that sells unofficial subdivided land via a perpetual land usage license. Essentially they dilute a parcel down until the price of owning a small piece of it is affordable to pretty much anyone. For an example I bought 32x32' of land in NorCal last night for around $260.

After digging a little further, it actually turns out that they allow sellers to list their parcels on the platform and sell to buyers like me. They boast 30-50% over fair market value returns when the math works out. Hypothetically, I could buy cheaper off grid properties in CA and relist/flip.

Total long shot. Has anyone here ever dabbled with Minute Land from a sellers perspective? If not, can you guys help me find a red flag or something wrong with their terms etc otherwise I am definitely considering listing a property I have in NV.

4504,realestateinvesting,Challenge my long-term strategy before I purchase my first house,"I have a corporate job ($120k/year) with generous relocation benefits for homeowners. The company will pay closing costs in the departure location or give a home retention bonus AND pay closing costs in the new location. The company encourages frequent job changes (average of every 2-3 years) which can come with relocation (usually to another state) if I advocate for it. My plan is to relocate frequently and use the relocation benefits to enable my RE portfolio growth. I’m early in my career and could happily stay with this company until I retire early or until they kick me out. 

Near-term: I’m looking to purchase my first home in March, live in it for 2 years, and then rent it out when I relocate for my next job. Looking in the suburbs of Salt Lake City, probably single-family, 500-600k, 20% down, and many rent estimates barely break even now but could cash flow in the future. Home values have appreciated significantly in recent years. Purchasing my first home is obviously an emotional decision as much as it is a financial decision, but what criteria would you look for to make sure the home is rentable in 2 years and cash flow positive? 

Long-term: What would be on your mind if you had a long-term strategy of having 1-2 properties per area, with a geographically dispersed portfolio? What is your basic sell vs rent criteria?

4521,realestateinvesting,All tenants being evicted,"So I am looking to buy my first multi family.

I found a property in a Midwestern city where I used to live. A C class neighborhood - a bit on the poorer side, but not much crime.

4 units for $300K, the sellers are selling a total of 3 buildings with 3 units in each, so 12 units total for  $900K. Current rent $800, market $1050-1100. Cash on cash 17-18%. Sounds too good to be true? 

I could buy 4 as owner-occupied and the rest as conventional loans, they are open to selling all buildings together or just one or two. 

So I request the rent rolls, additional information, etc.

The seller’s agent sends me all that. Of 12 units…I’ve never seen this before. 2 vacant, ALL OTHER TEN behind on rent and being evicted. Some are 1 month behind, some 7-8 months. They seem to have used Covid relief funds and ran out.

The folder has notes like “manager has no communication with any tenants except one”, “the tenant moved out, his wife stayed, and he moved into a vacant unit”. WTF??

It seems like the management must be incredibly incompetent. Who did they place in those units?! On top of that - and I am not an American, so I don’t know if this is common, but I would think it’s a huge violation of privacy - the folder has names of all tenants, their phone numbers, etc. Obviously I am not going to do anything with that info, but sounds very incompetent to leak it?

Everything would need a lot of work. Many units are trashed. 

What are your thoughts? Is the area much worse than I thought? Awful management? 

Or could it be a great deal from incompetent bleeding sellers, especially if picked at another 15-20% discount? They are ready to commit to evicting everyone prior to sale. 

Maybe minimal non-fancy reno and Section 8 material?"
4522,realestateinvesting,Help with analyzing a deal,"Hey all, I’m in need of some input from other Investors. I’m fairly new to investing (have a few properties, all paid outright. No section 8 tenants previously, no mortgages other than my primary). 

I’m looking at a property (2 bed 2 bath condo) right now for sale at 70k. There’s a tenant in place on section 8. Tenant pays $350. Voucher pays 300. HOA fee is 117. Insurance ~ 25. Taxes ~ 70. These are per month numbers.  Tenant always pays on time. 

Market rate rent is 850-900. Based on the HUD website, section 8 would pay about 840 for a 2 bed unit. 

I am planning to finance this deal at 6.625% with 2 points through a 30 year mortgage. 25% down (offering 64,000) for the property. Closing costs about 5k including escrow. Loan P&amp;I would be 319 or so per month. With PITI and HOA: 537 per month give or take a few dollars. 

Anyways, I have some concerns about HOA special assessments (the outside of the units look rough - likely needs new siding and there’s evidence of wood rot on other buildings in the neighborhood - there’s Multiple buildings that are part of HOA)

With current rent at 650, cash flow would be low (127) per month. At market rate of 850, cash flow would be about 327 per month. Not including loan pay down. 

If I can get rent up to 850, cap rate would be about 11% and with about 24k of my cash up front, COC return would be about 14%. If I can’t Get rent Up, looking at low returns. Tenant is month to month. But is old and I would not want to evict without them having a place to go.

Thanks for all the useful info you post here. I'm planning to buy my first rental property in three years. 

What should I be researching during the next three years to prepare me for having renters and a rental property I also live in?

I'm looking primarily at NYS but also the tri-state area. This will be my first house so it will be using an FHA loan unless I find a better option. I'm looking to purchase a multifamily in the range of 150k -250k, so I'm expecting it to be needing some elbow grease or in a bit of rougher area - which is okay. I'm intending to put 20% down as of now and looking at smaller cities that have a large student and grad student population. 

Any advice would be great as I'm really looking to soak up all the knowledge I can between now and when I buy the property. 

Thanks!"

Things where going well. We finished the renovations which cost more than expected but we did plan on that. We got it refinanced but by the time we did the loan rates had skyrocketed. But at least we got out of the HML. The property is not in the greatest of neighborhoods but there are a lot of good rentals over there. We have not been able to get a tenant for 3 months. Our PM is good but I just feel like no one qualifies in this area. Sadly too some teenagers broke in to the property and messed things up. Going to cost more money to fix. Decided to give up and just sell for a loss. Problem now is we can’t find a cash buyer. Contacted a few and have even been willing to lower the price and have not herd back. I fear this is the worst situation I can be in where I can’t rent the property and can’t sell it. The cash buyers are offering lower than the loan amount which we can empty our savings and pay down a to cover but only so much. And we can only do so if we get an offer. Just feel really down about this and looking for any help, advice, or sympathy. Uh just really struggling right now."

4552,realestateinvesting,Due on sale clause?,"I’ve never encountered this problem as most banks don’t necessarily enforce the due on sale clause, long as the person who received loan is in good standing with bank. Main reason is it usually costs more for a bank to proceed with due on sale clause, court costs etc. My preferred method for real estate is seller financing as I’ll usually pay more than asking price and set up payment plans to the seller. Majority of times the house has been payed off for a while. A few times though the house is not, so ill get the deed and continue paying seller monthly payments and they usually pay their mortgage off which is not usually a lot. And the bank will definitely receive notice that the deed has been transferred but so long as the original borrower has a god history the banks don’t really care. Though there a few that do. So what are my options I’m thinking of the following remedies, but I’m all ears for any other avenues! Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

A. Deed it back then purchase on a lease option 

B.Draw up some kinda of agreement on sale then get it recorded at county court?"

4571,realestateinvesting,First time home buyer - how can my family’s assets create opportunity?,"Like many millennials living in southern CA, my wife and I are struggling to see how homeownership is possible. Annual income is like 180k, projected to be ~250k in the next 2-3 years. I would categorize that as average or maybe a little higher than average but still I can’t make the math work for a modest home. 

I have an idea that may be a creative solution but hoping for some feedback.

My family owns a dilapidated beach front property that hasn’t been utilized in about 10-15 years. The lot is very valuable but the house needs to be completely renovated/rebuilt. So, it’s just sitting there, completely underutilized other than holding and gaining value through the years. 

My proposed thought is for my family to sell it and reinvest the proceeds into a tax advantaged entity that would purchase a home or two- one for me and one for my sister who is in a similar situation.

The real estate entity would then lease the home to me and we would pay monthly rent of no more than 30% of our income. The entity would use the income for property tax, maintenance, etc. - just like a normal rental agreement. Surplus would be enjoyed or invested however my parents wanted. However my aging parents would likely turn much of this responsibility to me.

Basically I want my family’s assets to act as a mortgagee, opening an otherwise impossible opportunity. Instead of my monthly rent going to a bank or landlord, it will contribute to a family trust and future inheritance. 

Does this makes sense conceptually/legally? What would something like this look like? Structure of ownership? Tax considerations?

I know about house hacking but am not sure if that's necessary for our financial situation:

-5k in emergency funds
-63k in my savings account, and climbing
-My salary is a bit over 80k a year, my wife makes 10k a year while in school which is enough to cover her expenses.
-Because our housing is free, we are saving everything we can ($4,000 a month) until we have to move out.
-I owe 32k in student loans at 7%, which are deferred until June next year (could be 22k if Biden's loan forgiveness passe, but not likely )
-No other debt as we own our cars outright and her tuition is covered
-Credit score of 760, she doesn't have credit yet

I think we're in a decent spot financially but am trying to figure out our best options. We live in the suburbs of Detroit where you can get a simple starter home in a good area for 160k-200k, and a solid duplex in a good area will cost around 300k. At that price you can get properties with more units and income in actual Detroit, just not sure if that's risky considering that's a lower-income housing market

Is it possible for us to secure loans for both an investment multiunit with 25% down, (maybe 72kish) and a cheaper starter home halfway through next year? My main concern is securing a loan for an affordable starter home, if I've already taken out a loan for a 300kish investment property.  That is, if I can even qualify for THAT at my income level.

To meet the 70% rule of thumb: `(80+28)/0.7 = 154k`. Meaning, if I rehab and decide to flip, it needs to sell for around $**154k** (to meet the 70% rule). 

As  Tarl Yarber says, ""Every good BRRR is a good flip first.""

**Comps in the past three months:**

* Coincidentally, a renovated 2-bed, 1-bath (900 sq-ft) sold in the same neighborhood for $**154k**. Although, it has a 1.5 car garage and the attic looks like it could be made into a third bedroom. 
* Another SFH sold for $139k. Although, again there is a 1 car attached garage and all brick/stone construction. 
* Two more brick SFHs sold for $191k and $200k each with 1 car detached garage in a different further off neighborhood. 

The rest, 16/20 are 3+ bedroom SFHs in that area. I excluded all properties that were not SFH and further away from that location. I lived in this city most of my life. I know it well. It's not a bad area.

I'm assuming this does not actually work because Robert Kiyosaki (author of Rich Dad Poor Dad) is worth only $100M. 

What am I missing here? Are there some tax laws that make it harder once you cross $10M or so? Does it become harder to find new properties? Does simply keeping tabs on your property managers at the 10M level become hard?"

4623,realestateinvesting,"Condo above ours is damaging our condo repeatedly, refuses to provide insurance info","About a year ago we purchased our first condo and hadn't yet put house insurance in place when the owner of the unit above us had a flooding in their bathroom that leaked down and damaged ours. We immediately went upstairs to help his tenants stop the flooding and saw the bathroom was in complete disrepair.

Emergency repairs were done by the strata corp, but the owner refused to provide us with his insurance info. He at first claimed that there was no flood and it must have been our unit (i.e. he lied). When we told him that we witnessed it from his unit and had pictures, he then claimed it was the strata building's responsibility. 

Drywall repair is relatively inexpensive and without insurance we didn't feel like we had much recourse except small claims, which wouldn't be worth the hassle. So we got insurance, did the repair ourselves, and took it as lesson learned.

Fast forward to today when THE EXACT SAME THING happened again and we are still dealing with this guy refusing to take accountability. We have a $1000 deductible for water damage which is more than the repairs would cost, but we don't feel like we should be paying for this damage or repairing our bathroom every 6 months because of his negligence. Can someone help us navigate this?"

4625,realestateinvesting,Want to start my REI journey - loose plan of action,"Me and my wife are currently homeowners, bought a house for 145k in '17 and its likely worth around 280k. I haven't had it appraised or anything, but my neighbor sold his house for 270k in Jan '21 and since prices have been rising, I feel like that's what I can realistically sell it for (conservative estimate). I've been getting cash offers by various investment firms to buy it outright for $230-240k (which is a lowball I'm sure)

The house is on a VA home loan, meaning I paid very little down when I bought it  - we currently owe 130k at 3.5% fixed rate, $940 mortgage payments.

What I want to do is rent out a house for me and my family to live in while I fix up and sell this home (probably needs 4-5k in repairs). I don't think this would take me more than 2-3 months, and I'm comfortable spending extra money on a rental in the meantime - partly because my family is in need of a bigger space anyways and its too much of a pain in the ass trying to do anything in a house full of kids and pets. Selling the house will allow me to access the equity in my home, and free up my VA home benefit at once.

I then plan on getting another primary with a VA loan (with 5-10k down for optimal rate), and use the rest of the cash for purchasing another property to rent out. I'd love for the second property to be a duplex but there's not many MFH around my area that aren't super old and dilapidated, so it might just end up being a SFH. 

Does this sound like a good plan for starting out? Any tips for a newbie?"

4634,realestateinvesting,Seller's protection against Misrepresentation/Nondisclosure Claims?," In a litigation happy society, even when you do everything properly, you can never feel too safe about lawsuits that can be extremely expensive.

As an owner, you have your property owner's policy. However, after you sell the property to a buyer, you have no insurance to protect you if within the next year or so the buyer tries to argue that there was a material misrepresentation and sues you. Is there any insurance that a seller can purchase to protect against this risk? I know real estate brokers can get their own e&amp;o coverage for themselves. But what about the seller?

Here is a nightmare hypothetical situation. What if after the sale happens, the buyer has a tenant suffer a fatal accident on the property. While the tenant probably can't pursue you if you were not the property owner at the time the accident happened, what if the new owner brings you in arguing the accident resulted from some undisclosed defect on the property.

4636,realestateinvesting,Dad wants to invest 300k,"This was the best sub I could think of and if there’s is an other one that’s better please let me know. 

So my dad came to me and shared his idea of pulling 300k from his 401k (accounting for taxes and not pulling 100% of it out) and use it as a down payment to buy me a house for around 400k if the housing market allows it come next year. He thinks there could be a crash. I kinda think so but I definitely couldn’t say. I already have a tiny place that I own and technically paying him back on right now. That part is a little complicated but the just is, my sister and I got a property together, she got the original house and my dad fronted the cash to build out little 700sqft place, and I’m paying back that money. 

He thinks it’s a good investment for me and my wife to be set up after he’s gone by having a home and renting the smaller 700sqft as a passive income. He has other money tucked away so it won’t effect him. 

Besides attempting to buy a house here in California, is there maybe other options to consider investing property wise? I just want to have other avenues lined up if he wants to invest if nothing opens up in our price range."
4637,realestateinvesting,Modular Micro Home,"So...in Feb 2020 (yeah, I know) I decided it would be a brilliant idea to buy a bit of vacant land in Oakland CA.

At this point, I just want to find a co-partner to develop a property and rent them for short term stays.

4644,realestateinvesting,Options For Building an Infill Duplex on Existing Property,"I am trying to decide on whether to add a new construction duplex on my existing triplex property vs using the equity on the tri to buy more rental properties.

I bought the triplex in 2017 for 280k in a centrally located neighborhood of a major/desirable sun belt city.  The place was beaten up but I have been redoing (sweat equity) one unit at a time as time/money/renters moving out allows.  

$260k left on loan 3.99% rate.  Gross cash flow minus mortgage is about $2,500/mo.  The last refi appraisal from two years ago was about $600k.  The lot has enough room to construct a two-story efficiency duplex (\~700 sf per floor), to make it a total of 5 units.  The zoning allows for this and it is not a problem from a permitting/zoning perspective.

In every analysis I do, it makes sense to pay the \~$200/sf for new construction ($280k total) vs trying to buy more rental properties elsewhere with the tri as collateral (beat-up multifamily units are way more than $200 a sf here).

Wondering what my options are to get a construction loan secured by the investment property (not a primary)?  Investment property HELOC seems like the best to preserve the 30-year fixed rate.  However, having trouble finding an investment property HELOC for this scenario.  Once the 5 plex is in place I would like to expand to other properties/cities with the 5 plex anchoring all the rest of the financing.

Is there any other options i have not considered to get this done?  Any other flaws in my thinking?

The two trends of SFH and townhouse seems to stick pretty close prior to Covid.

So if you have same amount of money  to invest in either SFH or twonhouse/condo, they will appreciate pretty much the same.

Besides, SFH owners spend a lot money on improvements that are not taken into account on those data.

I know some people may mention their SFH appreciate a lot more but townhouse/condo dropped during Covid. But Covid is a special timeframe  that might not exist again. So we should take it out of the formula.

As a business owner, I’m putting my money back in constantly - as it’s growing and the returns are much greater than owning property, etc.

I’m aware that I can only “own” it for like 30 years and then I have to extend it by purchasing the land for another 30 or so years.

It’s getting old changing the place I stay at everytime I move and I can offset costs through AirBnB while I’m away.

My goal is not to make money on the first property. Just to offset costs and have a stable location.

I have a rental in KC that has been vacant for a year. Eviction, lots of repairs, etc. My manager has been extremely slow to communicate and blames me for any issue instead of taking responsibility. Updates are vague and the house is still vacant after being listed for nearly 60 days. 

I'm firing them as my management. I can't take it anymore. They're so inept and when I complain they tell me it's my fault, or that I don't understand, etc. Extremely childish behavior.

He didn't know any further details, and he didn't give me enough to get any results on Google, but I'm hoping someone here knows what he's talking about.

His thought was that, if I owned more than 5 units in Virginia, then I would be subject to different rules and regulations regarding tenant screening and property management, almost like I was a professional landlord as opposed to just renting out my own place.

4693,realestateinvesting,Non-Passive Income on Rental Property?,"I'm preparing to purchase my first property in the next year (either to rent or live in), and am having trouble researching how the investment should be held from a tax perspective. 

About Me: 
*Filing Single
*Non-Real Estate Professional 
*W2 income; income above government thresholds

I see benefit in having the investment be a rental property under an LLC, as I'd be able to deduct expenses from the rental income (e.g., utilities, property management, insurance, depreciation, etc.). I've learned that can file this LLC under Schedule C, alongside my W2 filing. 

With this said, when taking into account the interest deduction from the mortgage, I'll be at a deep loss - which would be PASSIVE and cannot be offset against my W2 income (unless I Airbnb or become active in real estate). 

How do W2 income earners typically manage this situation? Can I somehow pass-through the rental property's mortgage interest deduction to my W2 income? 

Any advice on this first investment is appreciated! : )"

4695,realestateinvesting,Help me understand the stickiness of Rents,"This is what i've been thinking lately about the stickyness of rents. Caveat, I have never taken a class on economics, so please forgive these thoughts if they are wrong. If you can correct me or fill in more details, I would love it!

(AMONG OTHER FACTORS), I think that rents are related in part to the true monthly cost of mortgages. It seems that the true monthly cost isn't discussed when we compare RE prices with Rents, or at least I don't see it discussed as much.

I would describe the 'true cost' as what a buyer wants to pay per month. I believe MOST buyers are thinking in terms of what they can afford per month, not the price of the property. Disregarding other factors (ie maintenence, HOA etc), that's basically the principal + interest rates.

That 'cost' has steadily gone up and up and up, more so than inflation itself in the recent years. Not withstanding regionality, I don't believe that it's come down on average in the recent years, even with the rate increases. As rate increases go up, the selling price of the house comes down, but true cost stays relatively the same, or continues to go up a little. True cost has basically just shifted more toward interest, less towards principal.

I think Rents are far more a function of this 'true cost' (interest + principal), than the selling prices of houses. Am I thinking on the right lines? Does True Cost have a more accepted term? What am I missing?

I don't see 'true cost' coming down anytime soon. I think of that's why rents are stickier, so I feel like rents will stay where they are at least for the forseeable future.

please correct any terminology or ideas with actual economic knowledge :)"
4696,realestateinvesting,Advice About Building a Vacation Rental Portfolio,"Looking for advice on what are potential next steps given this situation which applies to a family member.

They currently own 2 homes in vacation rental locations (weekly rentals - not AirBnB).

* 1 house is in a very good, high-end tourist location and is currently cash flow positive after all management expenses, fixes/improvements and mortgage + has about 1 million in equity.
* 2nd house is in a location that is not as vacation friendly and is slightly below break even with about 100k in equity.

The Goal is to expand the vacation real-estate portfolio in location 1 to 4-5 houses eventually. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Options Being Considered:**

1. Currently considering selling the 2nd house and using that equity to buy another house in location 1 sometime in the next 12 months depending on the market.
2. Or, considering whether or not to use the 1 million equity in house 1 to get a loan for the down payment on a second house in Location 1 whether or not we sell the house in location 2.
3. Or, doing both options above at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

1. It seems like they are in a good position to apply the BRRRR model. Can that be done in the weekly rental market, or does that just apply to long-term rentals? Will a bank give a loan on equity if the intent is to do weekly rentals?
2. If you were in this position, what would you do? Are there other/better options than the above?
3. Are there good educational sources you can recommend specific to building a portfolio of short-term vacation rental properties?

New to this, so any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks."

4705,realestateinvesting,Should I throw in the towel and sell my house?,"Long story short I have horrible neighbors. They’re functional meth heads. They have many dogs that they do not control. These dogs constantly get out and terrorize the neighborhood. They fed my kitten to these dogs, these dogs have attacked other peoples pets (on their own property), chased people around the block. My neighbors sic their dogs on my toddler son (I stopped them before the attack thank god). I bought this house as a rental property and after fixing it up I rented it out. Things finally escalated when the dogs broke through a wooden fence in my yard chased and attacked my tenant and his dog as they walked down the street. 

I have constantly called animal control and animal control constantly takes their dogs. Neighbor has been arrested for dogs running at large (among other drug related charges). The problem is that in my state per ownership cannot be banned. So even tho animal control removes the neighbor’s dogs, she just goes and gets more. Since I don’t live there, I’m not sure what my options are. Tenants don’t wanna sign a warrant 

So basically I feel as tho I’m out of options. Nobody is going to want to rent a house with extremely aggressive dogs next door. They will never stop owning dogs. Unfortunately property taxes are so low ($300 a year) that she’s never in risk of losing the house. At this point, what would you all do? Sell?"

First Time Homebuyer

Hello All! 
Not completely sure if this is acceptable on this thread, but I have a few questions about everyone’s experiences with their first purchase. 
My problem is I do not currently have a down payment, and eventually I’m going to need one as I’m looking for a duplex, with a unit for me and a unit for prospective renters, to my knowledge this is called “House Hacking.” Eventually planning to move forward from there, but that is my first step. 
I have about $4k saved, and I’m in the process of trying to live below my means after I pay off some medical debt. 
I also have a Lexus, paid outright, that I was thinking I could either refinance for cash out, or trade in and refinance another vehicle. Either way I’d be looking to take about 15k cash out and finance the rest, or just finance 15 if I’m keeping the car. 
First, would refinancing and adding the car loan affect my DTI to the point where it’ll hinder me for a mortgage? (Most likely starting with FHA) 
Second, I was screwing around and got a pre-qualification letter for a mortgage of around 225k, would I be eligible for more for a multi family? I read you might be if you got a letter from the tenants agreeing to stay in the lease for a certain amount of time. 
Lastly, any opinions on the market? I personally was looking for Summer/Fall of 2023 to start looking around depending if there is a “crash”

4755,realestateinvesting,HELOC on multi-family residence to buy more property. Is it worth it right now?,"Hello all. Seeking some advice about taking a HELOC out on my primary residence which is a duplex. 

As of now. My duplex has a 2.25% APR so I really don’t want to refinance to pull this money out(approx. $100k), which is why I’m thinking of a HELOC. I want to start growing my baby rental portfolio out of state and I’d really hate to use my own money for it. My only concern is with the obvious high rates right now, I’d be borrowing at around 7% with a HELOC and probably another 6-7%. 

I’m not a seasoned investor, the people I know who have taken HELOC’s on their homes have not used it to buy more property, so I can’t really ask them for investing advice. I appreciate any advice in advance. Have a great week. Thank you!"

4757,realestateinvesting,Inherited tenant may be cooking meth,"I’ve had this building for a few years now. It’s a triplex in a decent part of town. I inherited a lifer tenant in the basement unit who hasn’t really been a problem or anything but always gave off meth vibes but I always dismissed it as him just being a bit slow as he never really caused any issues. 

A couple of weeks ago, the second floor tenant contacted me around 9pm to say her unit smelled like nail polish remover and it was so strong she was worried there was a gas leak or something seriously wrong with the building. I messaged the basement guy and he apologized and said he was priming something in the basement and didn’t realize the smell would be so strong and took it outside instead. 

I’ve had this on my mind since it happened and did some googling today and that scenario lined up with the description of smells I found online. 

My question is, when I do an inspection of the unit, what’s the best way to determine if this was being done? Has anyone bought those kits and swabbed the walls?

Thanks in advance."

4759,realestateinvesting,The right property to use a HELOC on?,"Hey everybody. I have been reading and watching YouTube videos on HELOC's and have a few lingering questions. A little background, got a promotion at work, bringing in 11-12k a month, 2 mortgages (1 rental - 80k in equity), DTI roughly 36-39% (new furniture on 0% interest card brought this up). 

My understanding of what investors do with HELOCs is that they use it on a investment property, refinance the property 6 months - 12 months later and then pay off the HELOC loan with the difference from their purchase price to the new refinance price.

 So my question to investors is, do you normally NOT purchase newer construction and invest more in used homes? Is there any special tool you use to see roughly how much more the house will be worth when you refinance? In the event the property does not refinance to an amount high enough to pay off the HELOC, do you deduce the monthly payment from your cash flow calculations prior to the purchase? I'm essentially a little worried I purchase a home in the future using this method and not pay off the HELOC within a year thus costing me more money. 

I have been using my county appraisal website and checking the appraised value of houses currently in the market to get a rough estimate. Honestly, I am not entirely sure if there is a correlation between county-appraised homes and what is on the market, but I have seen a few that the city appraises higher than the selling price. I guess this is why I am not sure if investors buy new constructions as there is no benchmark as to what it can be valued at in the future. 

Thank you all and apologies for the various questions, just looking for a little guidance in the right direction."

To me, this has been the best thing I've ever decided to do. No, it's not 100% passive. But it's very damn near it. I have may be a maintenance call a month. Dozens of units. I manage my own rentals. I regularly do upgrades on my own and believe me I take my time and do it at my leisure. This is a completely different work life than my engineering career which was always crunch time all the time.

From reading on this site as well as talking to a lot of people, I dare say 99% of investors and investor-wannabes aim to get a couple of investment properties and still keep their full time jobs until they retire in their 60s. In other words, 99% of the people I have talked to never seriously consider replacing their w-2 income with rental income.

Why? Again, I'm convinced deciding to go this path has been the best decision I ever made. Especially having read recently about the massive layoffs in the tech sector. I never have to worry about being laid off again ever in my life. I don't have a boss breathing down my neck. I don't ever have to worry about trying to find a new job. I've never felt this kind of security in my entire adult life before.

Living at home. Bills are $1500/month

Own:

4787,realestateinvesting,Reaching out to landlords to buy their properties,"The area where I am located (New Hampshire, Portsmouth) has very low supply of apartments and condos for sale which aren’t recent high-end construction.

However, it does have a lot of them for rent, and the cap rates are extremely low (4%-ish). 

So I am wondering, how unreasonable would it be to contact dozens of landlords who own condos/duplexes and are looking to rent them out and ask if they would sell off market? 

My ideal outcome is seller financing with low interest for a few first years at market price with a payoff in 4-5 years, or discount off market. If neither is achievable, I don’t see how buying in the area makes sense as you would cash-flow very negative. 

But for example if a property is listed for $370 000 at cap rate 4%, then selling it with 5% seller financing will literally pay as much or more without dealing with tenants. I would think if you don’t expect appreciation in the next year(s), it might not be a bad deal for the owner.

Have someone renting my basement which covers just under half of my mortgage + utilities, rent is a little under market rate but he pays on time and has been a good tenant for a few years now.  Have been doing this since 2018, some renovations in 2019 after first tenant got a promotion and moved out increased what I could reasonably bring in for rent by almost double.  Bought the home in 2016 for $232k, refinanced last year when rates were lower to 3.125 and got rid of PMI, restarted 30 year term.  Have been overpaying principle by about $150 a month to get loan paid down a bit quicker as I've had a bit more money.  Effectively both my mortgage payment and my monthly housing cost is about as low as it can get for the foreseeable future for this size and age home in this area, 2bd apartments regularly rent for more than I'm paying for my 4bd 2ba home.   Doing some remodeling to the interior of the house to make it a bit better, and my plan is to stay here (both this house, and this area) for the long term.  Estimate I have around $100-120k of equity in my home between what I've paid down on the note, appreciation in my neighborhood since I purchased and material improvements to the home (finishing basement, new light and outlet fixtures, better garage lighting and some other misc things).  When I refinanced last year middle of the road estimate for equity was $100k based on comps but I've finished more improvements since then, and while I suspect interest rate increases have put a bit of a damper on purchases the prices in my area don't seem to be declining by much if any.

I like my neighborhood and area, but absolutely hate my home's tiny 1-car garage.  Don't have enough land to expand the current garage or build a separate building without buying and bulldozing the neighbors house.  And realistically I can't see getting the garage/workspace I want attached to a comparably sized home for any less than $5-600k given the market around here, and at current rates that would mean a significant increase in my monthly outlay (likely more than tripling that cost, ouch) for housing, which I don't want to do either.  As a single guy right now I feel like I'd be really underutilizing a larger home that would be attached to a bigger garage and in order to make it make more financial sense I'd probably have to rent out multiple rooms and possibly share walls with other people (increasing likelihood of drama and other nonsense).  I'd also really like to put a car lift in at some point, which means I'd be limited to homes that have RV height size garages, and that also probably means competing on price with people who have RVs and being realistic, probably a descent bit more money to throw at a home than I do.

Basically, I don't really have any desire to buy another SFH, and in the area I'd be willing to consider those SFH's are real expensive and at current rates, finding something that cashflows or comes close to hitting the 1% rule is very difficult if not impossible.  I don't think prices on SFH's have really fallen much in spite of interest rates doubling since last year.  I know a couple local landlords and a few of them are even selling off some of their SFH's while prices are still relatively high, and seem to be putting that money into more light commercial and mixed use properties.  Above and beyond all of this, buying another SFH to either BRRR or househack and rent out the one I already have is unlikely to get me the garage/workshop I want even if it increases my monthly/yearly income.

I realize this isn't a normal wannabe-landlord-type situation where I'm looking for a property I can rent out and make money on fairly quickly thru some combination of rehab/refi and rent.  Tbh I want a shop first and foremost, I'm willing to pay in to get it (cashflow negative) and I'm trying to come up with creative ways to pay for some percentage of its monthly obligation, the more the better.  There's been a few farm/ag properties in the area I'd consider running anywhere from $275-450k which have pole barn(s) that would definitely be close to turn-key usable as a shop and I'd have some land around the shop I could rent out for vehicle/equipment storage.

&amp;#x200B;

My other question is how best to finance something like this.  I'm under the impression from Google and speaking with a few lenders that they typically want to see 20-25% for a second property and some won't lend at all for a property that doesn't have an SFH on it already (a property with a pole barn/shop that I'd like and a double wide seems like it runs $500k+ around here, and with a real stick build home that's probably no less than $600k).  On a $400k property that's $80-100k DP, and given that I'm currently stashing away over $1000/mo on my brokerage account I don't doubt I'll be able to reach that much saved up in a few years, but at the same time I wouldn't want to completely sell out of my positions (and give up opportunities for future gains), and I'm under the impression I can only borrow \~50% against my brokerage account value, which would mean getting the brokerage account north of $160k in value which would push the timeframe I'd like to do this out way further than I'd like."

I've found what looks like a great deal opportunity on a house listed for auction. I reached out to the realty company to ask of any known issues with the property and they said that it was sound and had no major issues, definitely needs some small touch ups but overall it looks good from photos and i plan to do a walkthrough tomorrow.

My concern is that the company listing it has a large mass of negative reviews and only a 1.5 star rating.

The vast majority of which are from upset tenants claiming the company to be very negligent in property management and maintenance / code violations. This doesn't directly concern me as I'm not renting with them, but I'm worried that reputation speaks volumes as to their credibility in selling properties also.

Many of the reviews are a few years old which let's me hope this is a past issue that has since been resolved, but there is also a review or two from buyers saying that they had issues specifically with purchasing at auction with them, which is my exact goal here.

What would you experienced investors take into consideration and base your decision to bid on?

4813,realestateinvesting,Chicago vs Philadelphia - for long-term rentals,"I'm an investor from the East Coast with a sizable amount of rentals in Kansas City and am now thinking about branching out into a new market. I've really been thinking about putting my money somewhere that could provide a challenge, but also be a place where I'd actually want to visit on a yearly basis (no offence to KC). I'm hopeful that one day these investments will ultimately pass down to my kids, so I'm thinking long-term and would really like an opinion on whether Philly or Chicago would be a better place to park money.

&amp;#x200B;

\- For my situation, Chicago is a great transportation hub since all my flights to KC go through Chicago airport. I am also a 90 minute drive from Philly. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I know Philly is benefiting tremendously from NYC transplants and others especially from work-from-home. The city is gentrifying and seeing good appreciation across many neighborhoods

&amp;#x200B;

\- Philly housing stock is usually from the 1900's which could mean very high maintenance if a property was neglected over the years

&amp;#x200B;

\- From everything I know about Chicago, property taxes can be a challenge, as well as the abundance of HOA's. The pension situation in IL makes me a little uneasy.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am thinking about climate change and climate migration and in the long-term, I think Chicago has tremendous potential to benefit from people moving inland. It strikes me as a very well positioned city geographically. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am usually a cash flow investor that invests in B-grade areas so wherever that makes the most logical sense is where I'd put my money.

&amp;#x200B;

Any opinions either way would be appreciated !"

My MIL at one point convenced my SO that having it deep cleaned would solve all the problems and it would be rental.

I disagreed and since then we have taken out all flooring and had it replaced, had all interior doors replaced (all by 1 had been broken-a 24inch closet door in the hallway), replaced the kitchen counter, and remodeled the bathroom. My painters are working on painting the cabinets, redoing the backsplash (previous owner cracked clusters of tile when putting in a knife holder), painting the walls and installing new trim (doors, windows, base board). 

While that is all well and good, everytime I mention something where a ""corner has been cut"" (example:shity transition from the LVT to the tile in the bathroom) someone says to me ""it just a rental"". So my question is where is the stopping point? Its all work I feel needs to be done but is quality no important when it is a rental?"

4816,realestateinvesting,Rental property - paying off early?,"All,

&amp;#x200B;

Back in 2019 we bought a new home and converted our old home into a rental property (single family house). There's $50k remaining mortgage at 3.75%. In 2019 and 2020 we were able to deduct the rental expenses (tax, interest, minor repair, lawn care etc), however, in 2021 and now 2022, our combined MAGI (married, filing jointly) is way above the limit outlined by IRS. As a result, we won't be able to deduct anything in our taxes and hence we'll owe a lot more to uncle sam. So, I'm trying to figure out what to do.

One option that seems to stand out is the prospect of paying off the remaining balance in lump sum, convert the property into an LLC and thereby account the expenses separately from our personnel tax. Are there any other options to consider? Open to hear and learn from the community.

4824,realestateinvesting,"Friend just bought primary res and is being nagged by HOA, can he move back to his other house?","TL;DR - Friend bought an HOA house, they're a-holes to him, he wants to leave and rent out the house. Is this enough reason for him to do it?

My friend used to swear to never want to live in an HOA but broke his own will when he and his wife made a deal for a property for his primary residence 10% below appraisal. I recommended that they go through with the purchase because the bylaws are lenient compared to other HOAs I've seen and the area is growing rapidly.  

He and his wife closed on the property a month ago and they are now in the process of moving in as his primary res, but the HOA managers have already been nagging him about moving trucks causing noise, their dogs needing vaccinations, recycling bin being full, the house needing to be power-washed, and an interior inspection needing to be done, etc. He's already got a million headaches with moving and is frustrated that these managers have no shred of empathy. I am shocked by this inhuman approach but it's the cards he's been dealt. 

After he moved in, he told me that he absolutely hates living there and it's been causing him and his dogs lots of stress. He's complained about the neighbors being snobby and giving them both nasty looks (he's an immigrant from South America). They're both very sensitive about their physical features and have tons of anxiety. 

He regrets that he moved in and wants to move back to his other house in the ""country"" which is currently a STR. 

 **I don't want him to accidentally commit mortgage fraud by moving back and renting his new house out.** This new house is in the best area for rentals and his long-term plan was to rent it out after 1 year. Is the HOA stress and lack of compatibility enough for him to justify moving back to his other place? 

I'm trying to advise him of some next steps and feel obligated to consult our wonderful community on this. Yes, I know this requires legal advice from a lawyer but I want to hear if anyone has been through a similar situation or how they would handle it."

And the monthly all-in (1340 [breakdown](https://ibb.co/YNSmsFR) I’ve been fixing it up by changing out everything that just looks dated (light fixtures, ceiling fans, faucets, kitchen sink {smaller iron replaced with larger stainless steel} replaced old bricking around the front flower bed with obsidian, new gutters, new a/c, cut down a giant Ash tree in the back - still need to remove the stump - hung a decent chandelier), since we have been living here. And I have tried to fix everything that hit in the original home inspections back in Summer of 2018 when we bought - specifically GFCIs and weather proofed outlets and some water siding issues were resolved due to the old gutters not functioning properly, lagged and secured all the wooden stairs.

The last thing that looks the most dated is the shower only bathroom in the master so I am thinking about replacing the vanity and the shower tile work, adding a storage cabinet, replacing the commode (previous owner already updated the other full bath).I have picked out tile and a contractor at this point and the vanity and the new medicine cabinet and storage cabinet. Am I over thinking this? Price tag will be around 3-5 k I am guessing. I was also considering tearing up all the carpet in the living room and halls to the bedrooms and replacing with some sort of tile. Same home comps in the South Omaha area are like 2k - I think with the bathroom fix up we could probably get a hundred or two more and it would be a nice facelift. More over, this sub has been slowly but surely been convincing me to try and rent it out myself and I have found a handy man, I think I will set up a new bank account and do an online rent payment and screening process, get a 1M umbrella policy, talk to a real estate lawyer and have them go over my lease agreement, and use a rental screening website or should I ask my real estate agent to help? I’m getting nervous about it one because of the spend on the bathroom updates and then two being out-of-state. Guess I am probing for advice/motivation - on the bathroom that a worth while investment for my family? Can I do this while I am out of state? Am I going to choose an awful tennet somehow? I am having doubts I guess. I am someone who made it out of the travel trailer and somehow clawed my way up to finally like having good means. Now I don’t want to go crazy and live beyond them. I’m trying to be smart and strategic and create the financial stability I have dreamed about so long. I am trying to make this liability we have been living in an asset. And create an ok passive stream of income. Phew I just hope it’s a good decision and not a bad investment. Would appreciate any tips advice or words of wisdom the kind people in this in this sub are willing to share. Thanks in advance."

Tenant is great and handles everything pretty much, have been there over 5 years, super passive property. Market rent for the area I could get $1600-$2000), they pay $1200 (this is the new lease they signed this August, it was $1100). I didn't want to scare them off with a big increase as they are such a good tenant. I didn't want to sell as I used to live in the house, it's near family and could be a vacation home one day maybe, ro somewhere for mom to live when she's older. It also has a huge RV Garage with second driveway that is currently free storage for me and potentially another $3-400/mo rent if I ever clean it out (it is not part of tenants lease). So I could maybe get $1500-$1600 gross/mo if I get the garage rented + current SFH rent. New lease also has 3% or $50 a year increase now, whichever is lower. I also pay $50/mo lawncare, this was already in place. Am I being dumb here or ca do something different? Am I dumb to even keep this property?

Insurance: A lot of big companies won't insure in FL, especially this house (1955, on the east coast). Old neighbor in FL recommended a guy, got a quote for $3500, 18k hurricane deductible 5k deductible, no flood. It was $4500 with those deductibles halved. I just wanted something cheap in case the entire house blows up. I have properties here in NE  with similar deductible, only $850/yr so this premium is off-putting. If I got this plan my cashflow goes from about 950/mo to 650/mo. Still money in my pocket and around 200-225k on equity in the house, but should I find a broker and shop other companies before commuting to this insurance? Thanks."

# Current Tools

* **Quickbooks** Desktop, which is used by several business entities that own the properties
* **Zillow** Rental Manager, since it can only collect rents for properties at one entity, we collect rents for other entities via alternative means (e.g., Zelle)
* **Google Apps** for email, documents (e.g., leases and templates), calendars

# Want

* **Property management software** to manage all of the properties at all of the entities and provide some separation of each entity's properties. We have a front-runner but want to see what everyone here suggests.
* **Accounting software** to keep track of the rent, improvements, etc., that is associated with each property at each entity. Quickbooks Online is an option, and the accounting firm that prepares taxes is accustomed to it though they could learn something different, but QBO is expensive since it will require several concurrent subscriptions since QBO is one subscription per entity.
* **Online bill pay and check writing**. If the property management software manages much of this, then this will be less important, but it should be part of the conversation.
* **Google Apps** for email, documents (e.g., leases and templates), calendars, and whatever else the new selection includes."

4848,realestateinvesting,How do Fee's factor into the BRRR strategy?,"While watching many of the videos on the BRRR strategy, fees aren't typically shown in the calculation, and I'm really trying to understand how they factor into the numbers. 

I usually see examples like below:

Buy: $100,000  
Rehab: $30,000

You put in 20% and use a private lender. So you're into the deal for $26,000.

After rehab, house is worth $190,000, and rent is $1,700 a month.

Refinance $130,000 of the new $190,000 value, and you have a monthly mortgage payment of $900.

You get you're 20% back, payoff the initial lender, and now cashflow $600 a month for ""free"".

Wasn't there a fee to borrow from the initial lender? Weren't there closing costs on the initial purchase and the refinance? Prepaids? Wouldn't all those things take away from the money down you are supposed to get back? Are the fees you don't get back just considered the cost of doing business?"

4851,realestateinvesting,Looking to purchase our first investment property,"My wife and I purchased our current home a couple years ago and have a low interest rate (3.2%) and reasonable payment ($2,000) a month. We are farther out of town which can be annoying, but we got a bigger house for the money. We are now looking at buying a smaller, older home closer to our family near town to move into and rent out our current house for a few years until we are making more money in our careers and can then buy a 3rd home in the same area that is a little bigger and more comfortable, but I just don't know if the money makes sense. 

New home is $380k (we're looking to offer $350k with a 2/1 buydown paid for by seller) at 6.75% interest rate. Theoretically we would be paying close to $1900 the first year, $2000 the second, and $2300 the third (hopefully would refinance in that time). We would be using a VA loan and put nothing down and move into the house. However, looking at similar properties for rent in the area it looks like we could only get $1700-$1900 maybe $2,000 at the highest but I like to be more conservative on estimates. 

Our current home mortgage payment is $2,000 a month and currently there are newer, bigger houses renting in the area for $2100-$2200 a month which makes me think we could only get $1800-$1900 maybe $2000 at the most. However there are quite a few properties for rent in our area. It's not as desirable of an area as where we would be purchasing the new home. This area is expanding fast though and will probably grow quite a bit over the next 10 years. We also have a yearly HOA fee of $150. Taxes and insurance are in escrow as a part of the monthly payment, we also pay about $87 in PMI as a part of the payment as well, that won't go away for another 8 years or so. I should also note our current home is rent ready and has new HVAC and other repairs so we shouldn't have any major expenses.

Our savings is $50k which we would keep for repairs and other costs and not put any money down.

We were looking at the situation from the standpoint that we could buy a second property and be closer to family while maybe breaking even on our current home and have someone mostly pay for it over the course of 30 years. From an investment standpoint I'm not sure if the situation makes any sense. I also have concerns that if the economy/housing market gets worse that rents will go down and it'll be an even worse situation because we can't find people to rent our house which is further out from town and/or will only get $1200 a month for example.

4853,realestateinvesting,Soon to Be Landlord - What Do you know Now that You Wish You Had Known Then?," **Background**: We recently purchased a SFH right around the corner from the 2015-built townhome we currently live in. While the interest rates aren't great, which conventional wisdom suggests is a bad time to buy, we simply had to do so for family reasons. We put a significant amount down to bring the rate and payment to a comfortable level. Our current townhome is on a 30-year at 2.375%, and we are in an area where we can, by all accounts, rent at $700-1000 more than the full mortgage payment (P&amp;I+Escrow) due each month (great schools, near lots of biotech and federal government). My wife and I make enough (and both have extremely stable jobs) that we could pay both mortgage payments, I guess, indefinitely, but not without serious discomfort - we chose the SFH we did because it was practical, definitely not a ""dream house"" stretch -- I only note this to point out that there is some financial safety in all of this, which is why I went down the path of keeping the townhome.

**Dilemma**: I have never rented before! I literally don't know my ass from my elbow in this space, but am a quick learn, and wanted to get some advice from you veterans. I am fiscally cautious by nature, so this is a big leap for me and a source of some anxiety, even despite the cushions in place (we still maintain $100K in savings) and I would appreciate any and all advice you are kind enough to throw my way (and bluntly so, if need be). I thought to jot down some areas of focus (though I am certain I'm missing a WHOLE lot):

1. **Finding Tenants**: I am planning to utilize our RE agent to find tenants - my thought in doing so was that, even in what appears to be a hot market, I'd like to benefit from the vetting and other such things that the RE agent can provide. A weird aside, a colleague told me that false claims of discrimination can arise when one directly chooses renters -- but I don't know if that's true or how that would even come about -- and apparently using an agent as a proxy, eliminates this. To be explicitly clear, our only criteria for tenants is that they have stable income, are creditworthy, and present as if they will maintain the property well. I am not looking for the bleeding edge in rent, nor plan to keeping jacking the rent up, and would gladly forego a top-end rent for a nice family that wants to stay long-term. Curious as to thoughts here.
2. **Financial Setup**: I was thinking that it may make sense to create a separate bank account, seed it with some capital and then use that account solely for the receipt of income and expenses, and use a site like Stessa to just track everything, and even possibly use their online rent payment system. Then it occurred to me that maybe it makes sense to create an LLC and run this as a business, with everything piped through that company. Is the latter arrangement an unduly over-engineered one for a single rental? Are there pros and cons to setting things up one way or another?
3. **Property Management**: Since I will live so close by and since our townhome is relatively new, I thought about servicing the property myself. Is this unwise for any reason? I work from home so I have some flexibility to attend to emergencies, and the like.
4. **Maintenance**: I plan to have an inspector (the one we used for the new home since they were really thorough) do an ""inspection"" of my current home to look for any issues an problems that I may not be aware of, so I can address them before renting. As mentioned above, I will use a segregated account from which to service the property.
5. **Form of Rental Agreement**: Where is the best place to find the most landlord-friendly form of rental agreement? What provisions do you think are must have? Useful to have?
6. **Pets**: What are your thoughts on pets? We didn't have a pet and I personally felt a townhome with only a tiny backyard wasn't enough to properly house a pet of any meaningful size, and am worried that allowing pets will create more wear and tear on the property (mostly hard-wood floors, for example) than necessary.

Is there anything else I should be doing, or thinking about? A sincere thanks to all of you for your insight and wisdom. I must admit (for a second time!) to being a bit nervous about the journey ahead but I do know that so many of you have done it with great success."

**Background:** Married and late next year will have one income (mine) after my wife has our first child. Household income will be about 80k plus some for side jobs I do and consultations or gifts. Right now between 100k-105k. Will maintain good insurance to cover all medical needs adequately.

* We currently have $12,000 in savings for emergencies (5 months roughly of necessities expense) 
* We have $6,400 in non-retirement brokerage account (liquid)
* We have $52,500 in a savings account that was specifically for a personal residence during our 2021 house-hunting (mis)adventure.
* Savings rate when not living on necessity expenses alone is currently at about $2500 per month or roughly 1/3 of our take home pay. Which is great but I'm trying to be more aggressive. I think that's our max if I want to avoid straining my relationship with my wife which is most important to me.
   * Keep in mind that savings rate doesn't include $1000 I put away for our retirement separately because our work doesn't offer a plan. I'm also not counting the $150-250 we put away toward vacations/fun that gets spent every few months for little weekend trips or family visits. 
   * The $2500/mo saved is solely going toward the purpose of investing for wealth building or personal home buying. Just trying to be clear. 

Now our options are wide open. I want to ask experienced investors what your next move (or what you'd wait for) would be? Help me be wise.

4857,realestateinvesting,"$3.5M in liquid cash, what is my best approach?","So to keep things quick and simple, I have recently closed out my 2 companies which have provided me with approximately $3.5M in LIQUID CASH as of the time of this post. I closed these companies because they operate in the finance field and I'm concerned about recession concerns. They were also making me absolutely miserable and robbing me of my joy, so that's another thing.

Given that we are entering and many suggest, currently, in a recession, I saw the writing on the walls and decided to ""cash out"" in early August 2022. Considering the state of my competitors who have ""held on"", I made the right decision. I hated the work anyway, as I was working 80-90+ hour weeks for the past 4 years, and it literally robbed me of my happiness.

ANYWAY.. I have about $3.5M in my savings right now. I want to 100% transition from my previous field into real estate investing (with a complete focus in multifamily rental property investing).

I know that in the next 6-18 months, we should be seeing a 20%+ reduction in prices.

I always thought highly of the BRRRR method (in the sense of practice only, since I have never had to execute this myself), but given the interest rates, if you personally had $3.5M in liquid cash, with the intention on going ""all-in"" on multi-family rental properties for buy and hold strategy...

Would you:

1. Buy all multi-family properties CASH and straight cash flow (to avoid the high interest rates)

or

2. Buy all multi-family properties via mortgage w/20% down payment + deal w/the terrible interest rates, and hope to eventually be able to refinance at a lower late?"

4862,realestateinvesting,How do you factor 'how long you'll fill an emergency fund' when taking on large debt?," 

The best case scenario is to fill up your emergency fund (6 months -1 year expenses if you are laid off) ASAP. However, for example, if you are given the 3 options ( Given that you already an emergency fund) :

1. Take on Mortgage A, but it will take you 1 year to fillup your emergency fund if your current one gets depleted to 0 .
2. Take on Mortgage B, but it will take you 5 months to fill up your emergency fund fund if your current one gets depleted to 0 .
3. Take on mortgage C, but it will take you 2 years to fill up your emergency fund if your current one gets depleted to 0 .

Which one is a 'safe' range? for you guys? For example, C might be too risky and you will never put yourself in that position."
4863,realestateinvesting,Assistance Needed from Insurance Experts! Cant Secure Homeowners in FL,"Good Evening,

As the title states - I really need some guidance from the professionals in this forum. I recently had a fire at an investment property in another state. A tenant caused a large fire while cooking. That claim is still open while the contractor re-builds. 

Fast forward to today and I am under contract to purchase a new primary residence in Florida. Almost everyone I talk to, including brokers, are saying that its going to be EXTREMELY difficult to find any coverage due to the open claim as well as a tiny claim in 2020 for accidental damage to a laptop.

Initially I was somewhat at ease because I figured that Florida's insurance carrier of last resort would always be an option, but its sounding like even that might not be a 100% guarantee. We already have a fair amount of time and money invested into this home purchase. I really dont want to get to the 11th hour and the purchase falls apart because I cant secure insurance that will be acceptable to the lender. 

Anyone have any suggestions? I am even considering looking into excess lines insurance, but im not sure if my lender would balk at that or not. Any help or advice is appreciated!"
4864,realestateinvesting,Landlord insurance,"I am currently under contract for my first investment property. A single family home and are researching what sort of insurance I need. The home would be rented out from but when I first buy the home I need renovate it which we project to take a couple of months to do.

I am having an issue understanding how to work the insurance out as the agent is telling me they cannot provide me landlord insurance if the home will be vacant during renovation time.

I will be financing so I need to get insurance to close in the mortgage. Has anyone gone through this? Any recommendations on companies that will make this easier to work with me.

Thank you"

I've been chasing information on the USDA 538 program for a while now but unlike FHA, conventional loans, info on this program has been very hard to find. Had anyone here used this program before? If so, how could you please give a general overview of the process from beginning to end? 

Some questions that'd be interesting/helpful:  
Did you use the program to buy an existing property, rehab it, or build it from scratch?  
Do you apply for the program along with a lender or do you work with a lender who already works with the program?  
How did you find said lender?  
How was the application/approval process for the project?  
Given the very strict income/rent limit requirements, did the project cash flow? If not, did it make financial sense somewhere else? (equity, tax credits, future sell, etc)

4874,realestateinvesting,Rent or Sell,"I purchased my small 2 unit 1,200 sf house in 2019 for $80k and invested another $15k in renovations. It has a small 2 bedroom lower unit and small 2nd floor studio apartment. My wife and I are upgrading to another home. I need to decide if I should sell or rent it. We are in an urban area in the midwest.
The 3.5% mortgage payment is $900 per month. The lower unit could rent for $800 and the upper for $600. Even with non-homestead taxes and additional holding costs it seems like a good opportunity to generate somewhat passive income and continue to gain equity. I have some real estate experience and would self property manage.
We currently owe $62k on the 15 year mortgage and even with the slow market I could sell it for $130-140k. So the alternative is to cash out the equity and park the $60k in an investment account.
Is this a no-brainer house hack or are there variables that I'm overlooking? Do I need to communicate this to the mortgage company or do they only care that the payments continue to be made?"

Basement just flooded, walls need to be redone. Animals (mice, squirrels) throughout the house, need pest control. Furnace needs to be replaced in a few years. Exterior siding is asbestos siding. Roof needs to be redone in 5ish years and gutters. All in all, seems like a lot of work is needed, which some of it I didn’t expect upon purchase. 

I guess my question is when is it time to accept that you made a bad investment and take the loss? I’m also considering the real estate market where valuations are decreasing a little and rates are through the roof. 

Any suggestions or feedback is greatly appreciated."

4880,realestateinvesting,In process of evicting tenant for non-payment and found out she's using meth yesterday,"Do I need to re-start the eviction process based on illegal drug usage? We're already in court for non-payment of rent, had our first hearing in the beginning of November. The judge keeps continuing our case as the tenant applied for COVID-related housing assistance and we're waiting on it to come through. We have our third hearing two weeks from now, but just yesterday I found out the tenant is using. 

There was police activity at her apartment on Wednesday, she went to the ER, but I don't know what happened as the police report won't be out for another 2-3 weeks. I was over there yesterday to let her in for a lock-out, and while I was there another tenant told me she admitted to using. I then talked to her about it, and she verbally admitted to using to me. I told her to try to get help. My handyman texts me later in the evening and shows me screenshots of the tenant trying to ask him if he knows where to get meth.

Since we're already in the eviction process, I'm not sure if I can bring this new evidence to the current case and get her out. Or, if I need to re-start another eviction lawsuit for this separate issue. It will take a few weeks and another round of court fees to get a hearing. I've tried contacting local lawyers (I don't have one ATM), but their receptionists just take down my info and I'm not sure if any will get back to me as this might seem like a small issue to them. 

Given that she's started using, there's a good chance she won't show up to the third hearing. However, she didn't make it to the second one and the judge still didn't rule against her since her housing assistance application is still pending, and he wanted to wait for a decision on the assistance before issuing judgement."
4881,realestateinvesting,Urgent Question (Need urgent advice),"Hi everyone, I together with a friend of mine are about to purchase a rental property. After purchasing the property, we plan to create an LLC and put the property there. We have put the same amount of effort on finding this property, finding the right inspector,... However, we are planning to put different amount of down payment for the loan that we are getting together (both of our names are in the loan). If everything goes well the property will cover the monthly mortgage payment and all the costs. I do not know how we should divide equity of this LLC (I do not know if the equity is the right word, I mean the ownership). I was thinking that we should divide it with the ratio of the down payment that we put for the loan. So if I put 65% and he puts 35%, I would own 65% of the property and will be responsible for 65% of loss and gain down the way. However, he said that NO MATTER how much down payment each of us bring to the table, both of us by default would get 30% of the equity since we are the ones who have done all the work to find this deal and get this LLC established. The next 40% will be divided by the ratio of the down payment that we have brought to the table (if we bring a money partner they will get the same ration as the money they bring). This means he can bring no down payment and will still own 30% of the equity (meaning 30% of the property). Or if I contribute 65% and he contributes 35% to the down payment, eventually I will own 0.30+0.65\*0.4=56% and he will own 0.30+0.35\*0.4=44%. Does this make any sense? Does this 30% ownership just because of contributing to find the right deal,... make any sense? Realtors do the same thing but get 5%! :)  
I have zero knowledge about this and I would sincerely appreciate of you kindly advise on this. Thanks in advance :)"

I am the operational manager of the company I work in and was just browsing through reddit (i m a new user) and saw this realestateinvesting topic.

I am just going to throw it out here since I ve had good experience on reddit for any others things going on in my life so... hey why not?

The company I work in specialize in residential (most are singles, but could be duplex/triplex and more) and we have been selling an average of 5 properties a month to invest in for less than 100k. We are not just your typical wholesaler. We take care of creating your LLC and follow up on your investment with the rehab and PM process. Once you go with us this is a partnership forming. We don't leave you alone in the wild.

Our projected ROI is between 10 to 13% after taking out PM fees (10%), Property taxes, Insurance and water/sewer (utilities for singles are paid by tenants). Of course, anyone in REI knows that there are more than just your typical fees (add maintenance, vacancies, evictions etc...). This is just to give you a % based on a perfect world. You should know before you invest what you can go through with REI.

If you want to know more you can DM me. I m not a seller, just wanted to offer the opportunity to invest for ppl with little access to money. 

Please, know that deals are cash or if you already have been approved by your lender then we can discuss.

Have a good one!"

4921,realestateinvesting,Buying out relatives on commercial property,"I've inherited a share of a commercial property. I think I want to buy out some of the relatives so that I can have 25% ownership but I'm concerned the property is not a money-maker. The property was owned by my father and his brother for about 30 years and has a tenant that has been there for 10 years. The rent is competitive with the surrounding similar properties. It's property-managed so we don't have to deal with that end of it. It's sort of run down like most properties in that area. Across the street is a large, recently upgraded business park.

The property is in a special ""heritage"" zone in the city which means any development has to go through a special review board. It's right on the border of this zone.

If I bought out my relatives it would cost me a little less than $40k. If they bought me out I would get a little less than $80k. If all their wild speculation comes through someday in the future, we could possibly sell it for twice what it is worth (they believe), but if it's worth as much as it was currently appraised for, my share of a sale would be about $115k. 

Does anyone here have experience owning commercial property in a zone that requires special review? Do buyers generally see that as a negative? Does the fact that this property has been in stasis for 30 years, generating a small income with little change to the property other than I assume the absolute bare minimum of maintenance seem like a good or a bad thing? We inherited this about a month ago and so the pressure to buy out the others seems a bit strong and I need some things to think about. I've never owned real estate of any kind before. I'm not averse to being a landlord. Also, I only just retired 4 months ago. It's a lot coming at me fast."

4937,realestateinvesting,"As a cash buyer, who should I be reaching out to get homes for sale?","This is in Southern California

As a cash buyer, I've been outbid on mortgage ready homes every single time by people with mortgages.

People who outbid are very emotional about the purchase while I look at homes like business transactions ensuring I atleast have a chance to cashflow, even $200/mo after expenses.

NONE of the homes that I lost would ever cashflow for the first 5 years unless the rental market went up by 20% immediately, like today. For example: The closest offer I lost by $20k was a $800k 3BD/2BA home in an area where such homes rent for $3500/mo at best and that includes lawn/garden service on top of typical maintenance.

I am getting frustrated and it appears like my only chances are with homes that arn't mortgage ready - which I am absolutely OK with:

but I literally can't figure out who to talk to learn about these non-mortgage ready homes. I only get to see them AFTER they've been flipped or sold and recorded in the county records.

Reaching out to Real Estate Agents and Realtors in my area has been non productive over the last year: it seems like non-mortgage ready homes isn't their focus or leads at all but I have no clue who I should be reaching to."

I don't have any debt other than my monthly rent and utilities payment. I spoke to a lender briefly (and will have a call soon) and he said that the new mortgage, insurance, property tax, other owned property expenses, and minimum payments that appear on credit accounts need to be under 45% of my income. Would my apartment rent payment also be added as debt burden? 

I currently split the apartment with my partner but the lease says that we are individually responsible for 100% of the rent. If the bank considers my half of the rent only + new mortgage payments, then I'll still be comfortably under 45%, but I won't be if they consider the entire rent as my monthly payment.

4947,realestateinvesting,At what point is my closing attorney supposed to tell me the cost for closing?,"I have a lawyer working on a wholesale deal I have. I’m buying and selling in the same day. He hasn’t provided any info on pricing of the closing costs. I’m worried he’s gonna surprise me with a huge bill and cut into my profits significantly to a crazy level. I was acting under the impression he would provide pricing similar to average closing costs in my state for both buy and sell side of the transaction, which I’m happy to pay. Now I’m paranoid though that he might do much more than that. 

Should I ask outright mid closing process what the cost of closing for these transactions are, get the number back, and potentially argue / negotiate him with the price and potentially fuck up the deal because I won’t accept the lawyers price mid closing and maybe he just bails because I won’t accept his price which would kill my deal, or should I just bite the bullet and wait for the bill to come?

Shouldn’t the lawyer be the one to be forth right with pricing for his closing services up front so the consumer knows? Otherwise can’t lawyers just hit you with an insane bill and indebt their clients by surprise?

I’m young and I might sound like an idiot in this post. I wish I handled this the best and right way from the jump but I didn’t, I’m expecting people are gonna respond that I’m fucked and should have clarified pricing before working with him.

4948,realestateinvesting,First Time Raising Money For Real Estate Deal,"I have a potential deal in the pipeline that could require about a million-dollar investment for a self-storage property. There would be two other investment parties as well.  I had planned to put 15-20% of this of my own money into the deal and then go to my business contacts to raise additional funds.

The plan would be to renovate the property, increase occupancy and eventually sell the business to a larger firm. 

My question is how should I structure the deal for my investors:

1. Guarantee a return on their money say 6-8% for the money they invested
2. Give the investors equity so that when it sells they get their portion of the profit 
3. Some type of mixed model where we also take a percentage if the company sells for a large profit
4. Open to other suggestions

4951,realestateinvesting,Bought the same condo for double the price - a story,"
Bought a condo in Jan 2019 that was in a bit of rough shape, $200k though and it was 2200 sq. feet with 5 bedrooms. One of the best decisions I’ve ever made as it’s right in the heart of a college town. I spent a little under 2 years fixing that baby up while living in it. I was recently divorced and slept in a sleeping bag in the front room and went to town on construction every day. Honestly helped my mental state so much having a project like that. 

Anyways, I made it super nice and learned a ton while doing it. In the meantime, the properties around me started going up and up in price as you all know going into 20’-21’. So during the heat of the market my brother who works for a realtor comments one day saying my neighbor to the right (mine’s middle unit) is selling his condo and it just so happens my neighbor’s realtor is his boss. At the time I was looking for another property but the competition was insane in my area so I was just chillin. Seeing the potential I jumped on the chance and we negotiated a side deal. I put in an offer to buy straight from him for $395k. The only difference between the condo I bought and this new one was they had built out a kitchen in the basement. Pulling the numbers and doing my DD I found that I’d still cash flow at this price. 

So here I am, king of the condo complex owning the max % of the complex that I can. I own 2/10 condos. I’m the monopoly man over here. The 2nd investment has been amazing and you can imagine how great the first one was at that price. So I bought pretty much the same condo as my first at double the cost and I don’t regret it one bit. Happy I took some risks and it’s paying off and I feel extremely lucky to have bought that first condo right before the market really blew up. Now I’m on the hunt for my third!"
4952,realestateinvesting,Stay in the market or move my $100k to real estate (NYC)? (x-Post in r/investing)," Hi friends, in 1-2 years I will have $100k in a brokerage account sitting mostly in VTI/VXUS that I've been building for a few years. My retirement contributions and safety net are all set, and I'm debt-free. I've been thinking about what to do since this pot is growing quite large. One popular option is of course getting into real estate investing.

The only kicker is - I'm from and live in NYC. As a first time investor, I'll barely be able to afford a decent condo, and I'm not sure that a single-family place is a smart risk with vacancies and potentially high interest rates. The only areas that seem to make sense right now are Jersey City/Hoboken near the PATH trains. Even then it'd be hard to get a good deal with my budget. Most of my family is here, and I don't plan on moving out of the area any time soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I only have a few options here:

1. Keep my money in the brokerage account until I can grow it more or figure something out.
2. Purchase a single-family property in the NYC area to either rent out or Airbnb.
3. Purchase a multi-family property within a 2 hour drive of the city? Maybe Philly?
4. I do have cousins who live in a suburb of Cleveland where there are houses for $150k that I could potentially Airbnb. They say places are always booked there because of the Cleveland Clinic, but that's another big risk for a first-time RE investor who doesn't live in the area.

Any thoughts would be amazing!"

4958,realestateinvesting,Family owned Cabin Fuck OVER!,"I'll make this brief.

Cabin was purchased from Parents 22yrs ago. I have 6 brothers, each were given 1/6th equity. Dad valued it at 120K. 5 brothers wanted out, which left me... I moved home from 15yrs in Alaska and took over maintaining the place for my folks. I did this since 1986, and have fond memories of the folks and slice of lakeside they raised us on. They are now deceased as of this year.

One brothers wife wanted in (two small kids at the time) her husband (the lawyer) was not interested initially but gave in to the wife. We took out a Loan for 80K and paid off the other 4 brothers. Paid off not and own the cabin outright.  I have a partner, 2kids, 5grand kids, dogs and X spouses (we love) and we (14 of us) use the hell out of place every other week. Lawyer brothers kids come once a summer and have no interest. He and his wife use it on our off weeks. It's been in the family since 1961, and my kids, grand-kids have grown up knowing what I experienced going to the lake like I did since I was 5yrs old

Lawyer wrote me an email and said its time to move on. Needless to say he's the most difficult of all my siblings to get along with and a narcissist diabetic drunk to boot.

We had a ice driven wind damage out boathouse on the waterfront in 2019. Insurance mistakenly approved the claim and we ended up getting the building reset on a solid concrete reinforced ICF foundation, new slab and it was cinder block prior which was destroyed. Almost lost the building which had a bunkhouse on top, right on the water and sleeps 7, with a BR. Due to insurance errors we got 45K to repair the bunk/boathouse.

Current market value is 277K which went up 6K due to insurance blunder. We have no formal cabin contract, it expired upon the death of my father this spring.

We are Tenants in common, each owning a 1/4 share with shares rolling to spouses upon the death on a partner. We're all pushing mid to late 60's and I have the help of my kids and spouses managing the heavy work up there.

The lawyer said in his email ""Our offer for buy-out is 300K!!! I'm floored! How would you proceed?"

This worries me because I inherited a long-term elderly tenant. I do not want them to leave!

I raised rent a little in the beginning (to $500). Now they are about $50 below market. 

Market rent is around $600 (one-bed, one-bath, basement storage, 1.5 car garage, technically uses one extra car space on surface lot that could be rented to someone wanting boat storage).

I crunched the numbers, and my projected leveraged IRR over 20 years (ROI, technically CoC return, over time) would be...

* 28% with a 3% rent increase per year
* 25% with a 1% rent increase per year

In those 20 years, that's a difference of \~$24,000.

I hope I didn't lose you in the weeds. This tenant pays on time and seems to care for the property (even though they avoid even minor improvements like the plague). I'm just wondering what you do or would do with a retired tenant. They were inherited. **How much would you increase rent by?**

They are getting a new furnace (\~$4000 total), new water softener (\~$500 total) and various updates (at least $500).

4969,realestateinvesting,Can I decrease mortgage caused by escrow shortage?,"I am managing a house that is currently in probate. 

While the loan account was ""tied up"" there was an analysis completed that doubled the mortgage. I assume this was due to a negative tax disbursement (escrow shortage).  There is a renter, but the rent is no longer covering the mortgage. 

If I pay the shortage, will it automatically lower the monthly payment?  The end goal is to have the rent cover the mortgage, at least until probate is done and everything is in my name.

Perhaps I can rent the property back to the previous owners at a lesser rate than their mortgage used to be, but at a high enough value to cover gradual renovation financing and property taxes.

A la, their old mortgage was $1500, but I rent it back to them at $1000. Property taxes are $400/mon and renovation loan would be $500/mon. $100 a month would be set aside for small emergencies.

Obviously fake numbers are fake, but I'm just wondering if anyone here has attempted this scenario, and what the ensuing results were - good and bad.

I don't really want to force someone out of their home in such a bad scenario, a decrease in monthly costs would give them an opportunity to save that $$$ to put towards a place that wouldnt need so many repairs, and I would get a house for cash free and clear with someone else paying the renovation costs?"

4988,realestateinvesting,Building a triplex,"Hey folks, I bought a really really run down place two years ago. I have tenants in it. Renting at 1950 on a 1550 monthly mortgage. The place is rundown but the real issue is it was build it 1910, the foundation is sloping and the ceilings are less than 6’ in some areas. It’s just not a house people want or that will appreciate.


My plan was to rent as is and then eventually add an ADU or tear it down and do a multi family. The lot is pretty big on the outskirts of a nice downtown area

I have never done this before but to me the numbers are drastically off. You know 2 years ago i was getting prices for 250/sqft but now it’s crazy.


I’m getting builders quotes for 317/sqft and houses are selling at 275/sqft. You see how much money you loose and that doesn’t even include the cost of the land!

All this to say, how do you make money building? Is a really a matter of waiting to find a sweet spot when building is cheap and real estate is high?"
4989,realestateinvesting,"DSTs? Anyone have experience with ""Delaware statutory trusts""?","I had never heard of these financial tools until very recently, I guess they are classified as a certain ""type"" of investment and therefore are not allowed to be advertised.

A DST is a trust that owns some kind of commercial (I think it must be commercial use, specifically) for a specific amount of time, and profits are shared among the investors, and any gains at the time of selling the real estate is also split to investors. DSTs typically lock up your money for a specific amount of time (typically 1-5 years I believe).

The advantages:

1) You can 1031 in and out of a DST. This is very important because if you are selling a property and have left over money from a 1031, or don't want all of it taxed at the moment, you can 1031 whatever amount into a DST. When the DST matures, you can 1031 OUT into another property, etc. You cannot do this with REITS

2) It is entirely hands off, you hand them the money and they hand you checks every month of the profits

Disadvantages:

1) Illiquid, meaning you cannot touch your money for the duration of the DST

2) I have to assume that some DSTs are not well managed or end up loosing money.

What are your thoughts on these financial tools? I have been a real estate investor for almost a decade and had never heard of them. I am thinking of selling a couple condos and 1031 exchanging them into DST, but I am sure there are risks. The upsides sound very attractive as well (4-8% cap rate, ZERO work on your end besides initial research)"

4995,realestateinvesting,A Novel Length Reflection of Where We Are Heading into Year 3 of Real Estate Investing," 

My partner and I own and operate a small home improvement company in a high cost of living area. We mainly work for landlords, doing turnovers, small fixes and total renovations. We have no employees and do all the work ourselves. We've been in the construction industry our entire lives so we have a pretty decent idea of what we’re doing. We’ve been in business together since 2019. 

Our industry slows down a lot in the winter. Instead of taking the time to regroup and work on our own house or do personal projects and hobbies, we decided to look into buying an investment property. Neither of us wanted to work for the rest of our lives and both of our families had real estate investments in some form or another. The first thing we did was identify an area to invest in because we could not afford to do so locally. We live in a very HCOL area (NYC metro area) so we looked for places where we could reasonably drive to and that we would one day be ok with living in ourselves. We settled on a smaller city in upstate NY after visiting the area and checking out the local housing stock. 

We bought our first investment property December 30, 2020. It was a 3 Bed / 1 Bath up and down duplex, same layout in both units. We inherited a tenant in the upstairs unit who was paying about 60% of market rent. The downstairs unit was disgusting, cat pee soaked into the subfloor and the entire unit had been sprayed this horrible beige color (over every outlet, huge drips, like wtf) - it hadn't been updated in decades. Lots of neglect. It was perfect (for us). 

Day one we cleaned and sealed the subfloors (literally we were at the house scrubbing less than an hour after signing the closing docs). We slept in a hotel that night then went back the next day and started the real work. We gutted the kitchen and bathroom, installed all new floors throughout, fixed everything in the common areas (basement, walkways, driveway, etc), painted, etc. Basically we fully renovated the first floor unit. We would spend five days up there (sleeping on an air mattress and not showering, eating meal prepped food from the microwave) then go home and work on our business, which worked for us because we made our own schedule and work wasn't as busy as it is in the warmer months. 

We finished after 5 weeks of work spread out over three months. We spent 7k on materials and supplied our own labor. We got it rented out in April of that year to a postal worker and her girlfriend. They've been good tenets and still live there. We rented it for $900 per month and haven't raised their rent. 

Side note - in December of 2021 our second floor tenant on our duplex moved out and we spent December and January redoing the second floor unit. New kitchen, bathroom gutted down to studs (replaced all the plumbing in that horror show), refinished the wood floors, new doors, paint, etc. We rented it out in February to a young couple with a dog for $1050. Up from $650 from the previous tenant. We spent $12k on this reno (should have been 8k but we ran into window / siding and plumbing issues we had to hire out - blew the budget but I’m glad we did it right). 

We bought our second one via private sale from our plumber in November of 2021 for $40K. He had owned it for five + years and was mid flip. It was a small two bedroom single family home on a double lot (that is technically a separate lot but we have it all fenced in as one for an extra huge backyard). We didn't start working on it (other than securing it and making sure the utilities and heat were working) until February of 2022.

The house was mostly gutted but had great bones. We did the same thing we’d done the previous year, though this one was a lot more drywall work that either of us wanted to do. We spent 5 day stretches up there and finished the house in about three months. We built our first deck and really made this house a luxury unit. We spent $21k in total on materials and again all the labor was provided by us. 

We had it rented within a month for $1250 to a college educated couple whose credit is almost as good as ours. They’ve been awesome tenants so far, I really hope they stay for a few years. 

We are currently under contract for a 4100 square foot triplex in the same area for $100k. It's my favorite so far. The house was built as a triplex in 1901 and is just beautiful. All new windows but tons of original woodwork and charm. The heating system is fried so the first thing we’re doing when we close is replacing radiators and maybe replacing the furnace. It’ll be a fun few days until we get the heat working and can turn on the water. This house really doesn't need as much work as our others but redoing three kitchens and three baths will be expensive and will take a lot of time. There is one three bed / 1 bath (the entire first floor - it also has living room, den, dining room, and a laundry room bigger than the kitchen - it's massive), a two bed / 1 bath and a 1 bed / 1 bath. 

It's going to be another crazy winter with long hours, bad conditions, and lots of work but I’m honestly looking forward to it. My partner and I are a special kind of crazy but we’d rather be doing this than our day jobs. We call it dusty camping. It's liberating in a way. 

When all is said and done and the triplex is fully rented we should be able to rent out the three bed for $1400, the two bed for $1100, and the one bed for $900 (it's in the downtown so the area is very desirable). We anticipate 30k in repairs to have it at the same standard as our other units. 

So in three years we will have gone from zero to six units. We will have invested approx $270k and will be netting about 40k per year in rents. We bought everything in cash so we have no debt. I know it's not the traditional road to real estate riches but we’re very happy with where we are. We’re very debt averse but know we will eventually have to finance something, if we want to continue to grow at this pace. 

Starting out our plan was to have 60k in net income to supplement our lifestyles. We didn't want to work all the time (like we do), we wanted to have the time to adopt some kids and be really involved parents. I want to be the mom on the school trips and volunteering with the PTA. We thought it would take ten years to get to a point where we could make it work. In six months we’ll be 2/3s of the way there. 

I will say that we are uber privileged and got a great head start. We’re both college educated but never had student loans. We live in an expensive area and don't pay rent. My partners' parents are in their 70’s and 80’s, one has Alzheimer's pretty bad and the other has Parkinson's, they own multifamily housing, so we live above them  for free but are also their full time caregivers. They don't drive and are immigrants so we handle all paperwork, bills, food shopping, doctors appointments, socialization, etc. Part of the reason we’re funneling every cent we make into ‘passive’ income is so that we can take care of them. We live like college students and save like 90% of what we make. We’ve never been on a vacation that wasn’t camping and still drink PBR. All three of our tenants have nicer cars than us.

If you're just starting out my advice would be to just go for it. Jump in. And don't be afraid to be unorthodox. Our friends and family think we’re insane. We’ve made tons of mistakes but we learn from them and our process gets smoother with every project (we’ve got the living situation down pat - air mattress with 6 inch foam pad. I’ve been cooking up a storm making dozens of frozen meals so that we don't have to eat expensive garbage food while working.) 

Anyway that's our story so far.  We’re turning 32 this year and hope to be done working full time in the next few years. Sorry for the length of the post but I did warn you in the title. 

TLDR: Went from zero to six units (three properties) in three years. $40k per year in net cash flow. Did all renovation work ourselves like the insane people we probably are."

It feels like we're getting stuck in a repetitive thought process where we start with a target return and a budget to work with. Find a house that could pull that return or better. But then get scared because of the work the house would need or the type of tenant that would rent it. So we shift to more expensive houses but do not like the return and circle back to cheaper but never seen to land on something.


Not sure why we can't seem to get through this but it's like we keep scaring ourselves out of opportunities. Is there a tactic we're missing? Something to focus on? Anything?


Bigger background if it matters:

About a year ago I joined a large discord community. Found myself talking to the same 6 people everyday and we eventually formed our own server where we spend about 3+ hours a day passing time while working our remote day jobs. We even have a trip planned in March to meet up for a few days.

All of us are in similar fields and watching the market shift towards a buyers market. Got us thinking of investing in something together. Before diving in we are considering a cheap investment that we can just walk away from and be ok completely losing everything if it turns out someone is crazy. And then working out way up to larger investments if we work well together.

So we have agreed on 20k each for this small investment giving us about 120k to play with. Targeting a 15% return but anything over 8% would be a win. Open to any location as one of us is willing to move where ever we decide to buy the property and will deal with walk throughs, showings, etc. 

First thing we did was look for properties in this price range on Zillow. Found some cheap houses in not so great areas like Pittsburgh, Albany, Charlotte etc. Iff we can get close to what section 8 is willing to pay the return is over 20%. Not such a big deal since the houses arent exactly magnificent but comfortable.

Then we get scared of rehabbing the property so we look for something turn key usually outside the budget so we need to get a loan but the return really hits the toilet at that point. And we repeat the process. Occasionally get scared of section 8. Then get scared of not renting. Really after writing this we're clearly a bunch of wimps afraid of any risk."

5022,realestateinvesting,Evaluating a real estate deal,"Hi there, thanks for reading this. I'm not sure what you'd call the specific structure of the deal or I'd Google it, but either way the insights of this subreddit are always appreciated. 

Anyway, the deal is for a piece of commercial property. It's already rented to a secure tenant at a set rate for the first five years, then increases by 10% once for years 6-10, and they have the option to renew for two five year terms. The ROI is around 6% assuming there's no debt involved (and I'd probably need a loan for this), which is okay but not great. Given the continued risk of inflation, I'd think this would be something to avoid, but the secure tenant does make it appealing. More importantly, the location is basically unmatched in this area for this kind of client. Even if they wanted to move, they wouldn't be able to find a spot as nice for what they are doing. I've lived in this area for years, so this isn't just me speculating on some area I've read about once.

5023,realestateinvesting,Whats the best way to tell a realtor the house is overpriced to make a lower offer?,"I have been looking at some multi-family houses for a year now. Right before the rates went up the houses were going for 1.1-1.2 million. Last week I saw another house that was listed for 1.2 million. These houses are all built the same, layout and everything but some are smaller than others. During the listing the agent and owner did not want me to see the 2nd floor because of a tenant living there. 

The previous houses I saw were in near perfect condition and had been renovated in the past 10 years or so. This house I saw still has everything original from 1940's. The old school wallpaper which is peeling off, an old stove from the 70's, the floor needs to be sanded and sealed again or possibly replaced. The whole space was significantly smaller than the other houses. During the showing I mentioned that the house was smaller and I know that because I have seen others. Plus I rent one and can easily see that the master bedroom and 2nd bedroom could not fit all the furniture I have in both rooms. The agent and the owner acted as if everything is perfect and just needs a small touch up. What is the best way to now call and speak to the agent to explain that it is smaller, everything is very outdated, it needs repairs and should be open to lower offers because of these factors?

The foundation estimate is only about 20k but there’s extensive sheetrock damage to the interior. I’m considering getting the foundation and sheetrock repaired, but wondering if this is wise with the current market, and selling price is already quite a bit lower than comparable houses in that area."

The purchase price and the numbers work from a nightly rental perspective at current pichase price. During underwriting it turns out that it’s classified as a condhotel. It’ll require more down but interest rate is the same. This is 85% because I want the property for personal use, it’s not a perfect investment but that’s not the draw for me. My question is if my purchase price was $1M assuming it was classified as a townhome and conventional financing works, but now know it’ll be harder for me to sell when that time comes because of its condhotel classification, what should my purchase price offer be? I feel like there should be a discount given it’ll be harder for me to sell than otherwise."

HELOC loan - $715 @ 8%

Operating Expenses - Taxes - $1300, Insurace - $1200, PM - 10%, Maint - 10%, and Cap Ex 5%.

Rents - $800 - $128 (vacancy) - $597 = $875 NOI - Loan = $160.

Roof 10 years, Furnace and Water Heater - 6 years.

Is the Cash flow too low? The house has new flooring and painting throughout. It is vacant at the moment.  Thanks everyone!"

5044,realestateinvesting,Zillow Background Check Tale of Caution (Do Not Use),"I live in a duplex, and leased one unit out to tenants. Well, I’ve been living elsewhere recently after one of my tenants with a history of arrests for assaults—including assault with a deadly weapon—went ballistic on me. 

I used Zillow’s background check to screen my tenants last year and what a total joke their screening is. The tenant that Zillow’s background check told me had a 755 credit score, 100% on time payments, and no evictions, in reality, has an eviction from 2019 with a $4k+ default judgment, multiple arrests with convictions prior to moving in, and since moving in, has gotten arrested a bunch of times and now has two active bench warrants out against him. And those are just the court records I was able to find by manually searching court databases. The other tenant? Served jail time for meth possession with the intent to distribute.

Zillow’s response when I asked them how they missed multiple data points that are extremely valuable in the screening process? First, they tried to shift the blame to the third party vendor that did the check, Checkr. When asked why the prior eviction didn’t show up, Checkr said that they have no record of my tenant even living in New Jersey, which is where the eviction was filed. Meanwhile, a simple google search of this tenant shows multiple New Jersey addresses. Not only that, one of the prior addresses listed in his application was a New Jersey address, and he’s been arrested multiple times in New Jersey. 

After I tried to point out to Zillow that it’s their platform that I was using and they should take at least take some responsibility, they started trying to incorrectly argue that if I’d used the prior eviction and criminal records to reject my tenants’ application, I would have violated Philadelphia Fair Housing law. I guess in Zillow’s mind, a background check giving green flags is the same thing as one that indicates that the tenant isn’t a good fit holistically or that additional research needs to be done on the tenant or that safeguards like requiring a larger security deposit need to be put into place.

$10k+ in lost rent so far thanks to the extremely slow eviction process in Philadelphia and things are about to get worse given that the alias writ has been filed, they’re still not moving, and they have nothing to lose. 

Instead of using Zillow, I might as well have pulled some drug addicts off the street and moved them into the newly renovated unit with brand new appliances in my $500k+ duplex. I’m not even going to get started about the chaos and disturbance them and their friends consistently cause. Or the unauathorized pit bull they moved in that has prevented me from going into the unit and has created safety concerns for me.

I’ll admit that lessons were learned on screening through this. Specifically, missing falsified pay stubs from a job my tenant was fired from. And not realizing that when the management company they rented to prior to this said no money was owed and no eviction had been filed was likely the result of either a cash for keys agreement or eviction moratorium related reporting restrictions. 

The bottom line is that Zillow’s background check was completely non-functional and from my experience, cannot be relied on."

Okay, the hypothetical situation here is a Home purchased in 1995 for $100,000. If they were to sell today for $500,000 they would pay capital gains on the total PROFIT ($500K - $30K Commissions - $5K Closing Costs = $465K) Or would they pay capital gains on the total sale price of $465K? I was under the impression it was the total PROFIT made on the sale.

Additionally, If they were to sell VIA Seller finance, and someone purchases the home at $500K with 20% Down ($100,000) Would they only pay capital gains on the 20% Down and then pay income tax on the total amount of payments made each year?

5058,realestateinvesting,how to buy a relative's house? requesting help.,"Hi r/realestateinvesting fam, long-time listener first-time caller. I'm not sure how to handle this scenario, the real estate agent I'm working with hasn't been able to provide clear guidance or point me to someone who can, any feedback is appreciated.

* My wife and I live in california
* The property is a townhome owned by my father-in-law - it is worth $700k
* The balance due on the mortgage is $200k
* PITI is $1,000 per month
* My wife and I are *not home owners* (we currently rent), but are also actively looking to buy a property

**The problem:**

* Father-in-law lives on a fixed income, he is retired. His expenses are greater than his income by approximately $1,000 per month.
* This deficit is offset by my sister-in-law (24 years old) who lives in the property, she is contributing $1,000 per month
* The sister-in-law now wants to move out w/ her significant other
* When she moves out she will not be able to contribute $1,000 per month

**There is a $1,000 per month deficit with my father-in-law's monthly budget. The mortgage payment on the house is $1,000.**

I have reviewed my father-in-laws finances with a fine tooth comb, it is already bare-bones. He is not able to move to a LCOL area out of california.

**My Solution?**

My wife and I are willing to buy the house from my father-in-law

* We have enough $$ to pay off the entire mortgage and own the property w/ no mortgage OR we can put 20% down and cash flow the note

What I'm unclear on is if its even possible to buy a $200k house for $700k? Will it appear on Zillow as sold for $200k? How does that impact the tax bill?

One idea I heard is we:

* buy the house for $700k but the father in law gifts us back the $500k in equity -&gt; we file some tax paper work to have the 'gift' excluded as part of his taxes  

   * I'm not sure this even make sense, what do you think?

Should we even attempt to buy the house? My wife and I could personally just give him $1,000 per month and as part of the will he leaves us the house upon death, is this the right thing to do?

What types of professionals should we be engaging to get the right answer?

Of course there's some work involved in owning real estate, and there are certainly horror stories, but people are negatively influenced because generally you ONLY hear about the horror stories and not about how people just owned a lot of homes and passed them onto their kids, etc.

First of all, real estate ideally appreciates overtime, and you will probably be earning a cap rate of 3-8% after all is said and done. The best CDs lock up your money for 5 years and only pay 4% right now, which with inflation, isn't very good.

Secondly, real estate is a real asset that you own. It's not just money that can be printed, devalued, hyper inflated, etc. It will always have a worth relative to the location and country it's in, and if your real estate is paid off you can survive even horrendous economic downturns and generate cash flow.

Finally, you can take out loans against real estate and still own the real estate. You can build off of that. With CDs you just tie up money for 5 years and get interest.

It just seems odd to me that whenever someone talks about investing in real estate for the first time, people are like ""just throw your money in CDs"". Why?? I mean that's ""easier"" but no one ever talks about the negative associated with just earing a small amount of interest on untouchable fiat."

I’m single, and being that I’m only “home” ~4 days out of the month, I just live with my parents (I’m in my late 20s) and list that as my permanent address since my leases in whatever cities my job is at is in my company’s name. After whatever misc expenses I may have, putting 30-40% of my pay into 401k, maxing out HSA and also Roth IRA, I still net positive about $3k a month at the moment.

With my background in construction and the fact that I’m somewhere new every year or so, I’ve been thinking of trying to find a place wherever I go next that needs some cosmetic work, buying it and over my time in that place working to fix it up.

Let me know if you would run numbers differently. A few other notes... we have cash to pay off 2nd mortgage if we want to create cash flow. But, the interest rate is low and our yield on it basically cover interest. Also have \~$140k reserves... but hopefully no large expenses since 1 year warranty work was just completed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stats: 

Price paid: $490,000 (locked in pre-pandemic sales price)

Property Value: $850,000 (most similar homes actually sell for $900,000-$925,000 but discounting for conservative)

Estimated Selling Costs @ 8%: $68,000

Net: $782,000

Mortgages: 

$450,000 @ 2.99%

$95,000 @ 4.75$

Cash left in property if retained: $237,000

Rent: $4,000 (realtor told us $4,300 more likely)

Expenses @ 25% of rent (mgmt, repair fund, vacancy): $1,000

Mortgage payments: $3250 (we have ensured taxes will remain same as non-occupant owners)

Net Gain/Loss: $250/month

Net worth items (Principal pay down of both mortgages, appreciation @ 2.5% - no depreciation factored in): $2,900/m; $34,750 annually 

Theoretical return: $34,750 - $3,000 loss on rent = \~$31,750 / $237,000 left in prop = \~13.4% return

We don't mind the short-term cash flow loss because our predicted new house payment will drop from $3,200 now to more like $500 or less net of rent on our new primary house hack. We will be saving $2,500-$2,700+ per month on top of the return and feel confident that cash flow will go up over time. Given the math, is there anything you would change in terms of calculations and would you retain the home, or take the cash?"
5090,realestateinvesting,Advice,"Looking for advice on what’s next for me? I bought my first home several years ago I owe ~160k. Estimated ~120k in equity. Mortgage is $1,090 a month @ 2.75 %.  It is now tenant occupied renting at $1,995 per month and the property management company charges 8% of rent. After the mortgage and property management is paid, i will net ~$750.

I have just recently purchased a 2nd home. I financed 335k @ 6.75% interest. My payment on the 2nd home is $2,800. It is in my plane to refinance this within the next few years whenever rates come back down.

My primary source of income generates me ~$12,000 monthly before taxes. Including both my mortgages and all bills my monthly spending averages about 5-6k. It has been higher the last months due to prepping first home for renters and getting 2nd home furnished and move in ready. 

I don’t have any type of mentor helping me so I’m asking for your advice on what my next steps may be the next few years to help myself grow my portfolio."

5094,realestateinvesting,unsure if/how to proceed with real estate listing agent,"I have 1 unit in a 2-family home that was listed for rent in mid-August. Initially at $2,000/month but that has since dropped to $1,700/month. I've been working with someone from a property management company who happens to be a real estate agent as well, and he handled the listing for the other unit in the building earlier this year. That only took a couple months between listing it and having a qualified candidate apply, sign the lease + move in.

For this other unit, it's been on the market for \~3.5 months now, 3 separate price drops, and only 1 application so far. That happened over a week ago, I signed my part of the lease but when I asked the agent a few days afterwards whether the applicants signed it as well he told me ""They just stopped responding to me. If I don't hear back from them today I will void the lease and continue to show. We were supposed to meet last weekend to get checks \[security deposit + 1st months rent\]"". That was last Wednesday and haven't heard anything since, unfortunately.

Curious how others have dealt with this kind of situation and what the ultimate outcomes were, like further reductions in listed rent, switching agents, etc. A few weeks ago I started to doubt this agent's competency, or at least his effort toward getting the unit filled with a qualified tenant. Every month I check the home's Zillow page to see what it's ""estimated value"" is (compared against Redfin's estimate), but the link I have bookmarked no longer displayed that when last viewing it, and instead it was showing the rental listing. And there are some notable flaws/inaccuracies like 1) it being listed as a townhouse vs regular multi-family apartment, 2) some of the pictures are very outdated (one shows a tree in the front yard even though it was removed by the city almost 2 years ago), 3) other pictures rotated 90 degrees and with a ""GoSection8"" landmark on them, which leads me to believe he just copied them from a previous listing before I even owned the home since I never worked with Section 8 before, and 4) the description says ""second floor of a 2 family home"" even though this is a first floor unit.

Given all the above, I'm leaning towards finding a new listing agent. Although it would seem kind of wrong to do that without any warning since the last 3.5 months of his lackluster albeit still non-zero efforts would go unpaid from the absence of any brokers fee. What kind of compromise or middle ground is reasonable, or even an ultimatum like ""no lease signed with security deposit + 1st month's rent by December 20th and we have to part ways""?

And I guess important to point out, this is a self-managed property despite me finding the agent from a PM company. I initially wanted to outsource the property management / maintenance for the 7-10% fee but the company he works for said it was too risky at the time earlier this year due to a non-paying tenant (and the other unit being listed, so no revenue then)."

5097,realestateinvesting,Q: how to optimize ownership and dividend distribution from a portfolio of multi family homes between a group?,"Hello all. I work with a small group of contractors (each is an independent entity) that is interested in forming a partnership and combining their assets under one roof. All properties are generating income, but obviously, incomes are different and instead of distributions, they want to reinvest 100% into buying more units. On top of that, they are ready to invest more capital and labor in the future into this venture, so a simple div per stock becomes a lot more complicated. 

What would be the best way to set up from the liability and taxes perspective? The goal is to shield the partnership and its assets from potential liability claims coming from individual contractors and vice versa, and to minimize taxes."

Philadelphia is a city I feel very close to as someone who went to Temple and it’s not that far from me geographically.

In regards to investing, I have a few concerns, which I’m hoping someone can speak on. Firstly, the housing stock in Philly is very old and mostly brick which to me usually means lots of maintenance. From old sewer lines, to water coming through the masonry, to outdated electrical, it seems scary for an investor. 

Other points of concern include pest control since many of the townhomes are connected. 

From an outsider perspective it looks like property tax isn’t as suffocating as a city like Chicago and tons of areas are gentrifying so fast. 

Has anyone considered condo investing in Philly so at least that way you’re not wholly responsible for building/exterior maintenance?

5109,realestateinvesting,Bathroom reno vs paying off debt,"In 2019 my then boyfriend and I bought a house at 229k. We've lived in it since and gradually renovated it, mainly cosmetic.

In 2021, I broke up with him. We continued living together and working on the house.

Currently, the house is appraised at 360k and we still owe 177k. This month, we signed the agreement to have him move out and sell his half of his equity in the house to me, 91k. 

I have enough saved to give him all of it upfront, but don't want to put myself in a financially precarious position in terms of savings, though I'm fairly certain my job is stable (great performance reviews and I've been there for 2.5 yrs.) Therefore I plan on giving him 70k when he moves out and monthly payments for the remainder of the debt, so I still have months of income saved. The interest he's charging for the remainder is 3%.

Per the contract, I have to pay him at least 1,050$ every month, however I have enough room in my budget to pay him 2,000$, which I would prefer as I don't want to elongate how long I'm in debt to him and would like to be relieved of his lien on the house.

Also per the contract, I need to refinance within three years to remove his name from the mortgage.

However, I have one final part of the house that I still want to have renovated - the master bathroom. After gathering quotes from contractors, I've determined it's going to cost about 15k to have it almost complete (the rest I will be doing myself).

I'm seeking advice regarding paying down the debt more rapidly or at the minimum to save for a bathroom renovation. 

I'm thinking down the line this could lead to a higher appraised value when I refinance, which could give me the option to pull more cash out and get another property, rather than using my savings. Also I'll admit, I would like a nicer bathroom.

Currently sitting on a good amount of cash and have the itch to get something rolling.  

&amp;#x200B;

One strategy I'm considering is buying an ""A class"" tract home in my area to move into, rent out my current house, enjoy the A class home for a few years, pay it down to the 50% equity point (assuming no appreciation), Refi depending on where rates are at the time, move to a more permanent home, rent the A class property, cashflow, hold it for 30+ years. 

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't sound like a home run by any means, but if my options are buying B/C class properties with 3% cash on cash in my area, it sounds more fun to buy the A class and get to step up my current living situation while adding another cash flowing rental to the portfolio (my current home). Considering the A class is a few years old, I feel like I could just have it sitting in the portfolio, never making a great cash on cash return, but probably attracting higher quality tenants, having less maintenance due to being newer, maybe riding a future appreciation wave, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, a nice lifestyle improvement today- potentially a good investment long-term.

“During the first year of Covid, the rental market froze and people postponed their moves. Then, in 2021-2022, U.S. occupancy rates rose to record levels. The market was on fire and many renters were priced out of double-digit percentage rent increases,” said Anthemos Georgiades, CEO of [Zumper](https://www.zumper.com/blog/rental-price-data/), a national rental listing platform.

“Now, as we enter the third year of the market since Covid, there's a very different story. Occupancy rates are in freefall, vacancies are rising, the fear of recession is biting, and rents have plateaued.”

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of an exaggeration or is this rental cooldown intensifying? I'm a bit surprised considering that the interest rates in the for-sale market have been pricing people out - I would have thought the rental market would have remained very tight."

It 180 pages of stuff but the main concern is the septic is to small and electrical is out of order.  Meters are switched around and spliced everywhere. This property needs someone to take control of it.  I was told it appraises close to 9 million if I can get him to give me the additional land.  Anyway I have a lender who will give me 40% if I bring 10% and have the seller carry 50% which I know he’ll do. My concern is the funds to get this place in order.  Any suggestions on how to work a seller financing deal where I can maybe get the seller to give me short term money as well?  I don’t have a private money lender.  Open to suggestion I feel this place has potential and still cash flows
5152,realestateinvesting,Rental equation,"Hi, my parents have bought a house that has a separate space that can be turned into 2 apartment units. We're trying to figure out what kind of percentage of the rent from renting them on airbnb I could negotiate with them by paying for renovations of the apartment units. I would also be doing all the hosting of the units on airbnb because they aren't tech savvy. Renting them out on airbnb where we are from is about double the revenue then long term rentals. The house is about 400k and the apartments already have electrical and plumbing done. So we just need to make a wall or two and furnish."

5157,realestateinvesting,Sell or Keep and rent condo,"The condo was bought in 2021 for 580K in a very HCOL city. Current loan amount left is 450K. Interest rate 3.3% fixed. 30 years. 

Monthly payment including taxes, HOA, insurance, mortgage etc is $2650

The questions is whether to sell it now for around 610K (this would be at a loss all in all) or continue to rent it out for $2600/mo (hopefully can raise rent to $2700 near year)

The HOA will go up 27% starting from 2023 due to inflationary causes. ($520/mo in 2023)

Where I live, appreciation will be around 3% per year for the condo market (hopefully)."

5167,realestateinvesting,Would there be any demand for luxury single rooms with shared bathroom? Upgrading from a landlord special,"I inherited a 6 unit. It is the definition of a landlord special—cheap flooring, thick poorly applied white paint, very outdated fixtures. The 6 rooms are about 150sqft and share an interior hallway, with 1 shared small bathroom on that floor.

The rooms rent for $700/mo and are desirable because they're downtown, in an area with few residential options (surrounded by restaurants, businesses, etc). The tenants are all on fixed income.

I would love to update the interior spaces, but I don't know if there will be any higher demand due to the shared bathroom and small space. I'm not allowed to add bathrooms to the individual spaces due to zoning restrictions.

5175,realestateinvesting,Rent to Rent HMO - too good to be true?,"The strategy of Rent to Rent HMO has caught my attention recently - it seems like a low cost/capital strategy to get into property investing. From my understanding, this strategy involves becoming a tenant of a HMO and assuring the landlord a guaranteed rent, however with an agreement in place that you can sublet the HMO at a higher price on after a light refurb. You basically take on the responsibility of finding tenants to fill up each room, paying the utilities and council tax, and so on. 

Initially the strategy seemed quite sound as you offer to remove all the hassle of a HMO away from the landlord, but I don’t see how the numbers can add up. Assuming the rent for a 3-bed HMO is £2,000 per month and utilities are £500, that is £2,500 that you would need to pay. Let’s say I want to profit £500 a month from this HMO, I would need to charge all the tenants £3,000 in total. For a 3-bed that means each tenant needs to pay around £1,000 for a single room when the HMO was initially on market for only £2,000 per month.

How would this even work?"
5176,realestateinvesting,Ski Condos,"I am planning on buying a ski condo for weekend use sometime in the next year or two based on what we see on the market, most likely in Summit County, CO. 

We are planning on using it for personal use for a few years while we save up to buy another property, then we would either rent out the first or second property - probably month to month or seasonal since you don’t need a license to do that, to add another income stream. 

For LTR prospects, would it be a bad idea to buy a studio condo?

We would prefer to buy a 1 bed 1 bath, but could probably buy sooner if we decided on a studio since they’re listing for $200K-$300K less than the 1 bed 1 baths we are seeing. 

Will we have an issue finding a renter later on if we go with a studio or will it be about the same as if we have a 1 bed 1 bath?"
5177,realestateinvesting,Should you save money for 3-5 years and then buy an apartment or a house?,"Yes... I hear people say saving will eat your money but I don't think if you save more than 5 years it will affect it that much.

I mean... getting a mortgage is nice you get to have it right now and  rent it  and it will pay off later on but what if you just want to buy real estate with your money every 5 years ?. (If you can)

Is it worth just getting a mortgage 50% of the property value  and start paying the bank  or just focus on saving then investing ?.

I don't think real estate will increase in price that much in 5 years yet you will definitely lose some of your savings for sure!. 

The question is ""is it worth it ?"""

Asking is $600k, triplex in a fairly desirable area in a major Canadian city. My ideas: Option A - get a private loan for $480k, get the stairs done as quickly as possible. Once the A lender approves it, pay off the loan, only paying interest on the private loan for the duration of the stair repairs, and then continue on with the A lender loan. Option B - get the offer accepted, do the repairs as quickly as possible, have the A lender approve, and close the deal.

I've used sites like Mashvisor and felt it didn't provide me enough flexibility into how high fidelity opportunities were identified and I always ended up falling back to my spreadsheets, so I decided to make something custom.

5207,realestateinvesting,Solar for home - potential future rental,"My wife and I are considering getting solar at our house but are unsure whether it’s worth it since we may at some point move on to another house after we’ve renovated this one, and keep it as a rental. 

I’m doing so, we may need to take down some trees - the large oaks around my house are part of its appeal so we are unsure whether we should do so. 

We also have the option to put panels on the back of the home to make them more hidden but this would require even more trees be removed. 

16 solar panels - Trina Vertex 390 Watt
16 solar edge micro-inverters 
System size = 6.24 kw / 7850 yearly production 
Solar offset = 82% (82% of my annual energy demands will be produced by solar with the remaining 18% coming from my electric company; around $48/month avg.) 

25 year warranty on the panels and inverters with a 25 year power production guarantee. 

Proposed financing is a 24 year term at 7.49% / $0 out of pocket / no payments for the first 12 months / $150 per month thereafter with the ideal scenario being that I pay off the entire loan amount of $17,816 as quickly as possible to help maximize my savings. The same amount of energy from my electric company will cost upwards of $75,000 over 25 years, thus, mypotential ""TRUE"" savings can exceed $50,000 in total, contingent on how quickly you pay the system off. 

Solar guy says homes with solar on average sell for 4.1% more, but my realtor says they can sometimes be a deterrent in my area (NW Arkansas). 

Question: is it a good idea to adopt solar in a rental property and/or a property we may eventually sell? 

Does the loan structure make sense for a potential rental? 

Putting panels on the back of the house will be less efficient but will improve the curb appeal. Which option would be more preferable for a rental or potential sale?"

Spoken with a few builders who have ranged from $205 to $300 per sq ft based on what we want. 

Can’t seem to get a clear answer on what all is embedded within that per sq Ft cost - any experience there? 

Currently have the following line items to try and estimate: 

Site prep/excavation ($20k)
Foundation/footers ($15k)
Septic install ($25k)
Utilities tie-ins ($5k)
County permitting fees/inspections ($20k)
Engineered plans, site plan, soil tests ($10k)

Building materials (buying a kit at $155k, shipped to site) *all materials included down to appliances, wiring, etc
Labor/GC ($50k)

Total estimate: $390k

This comes out to $250k/sq Ft

I’ve always had an interest in owning rental properties, and would like to use this opportunity as a potential start to my real estate investing journey. 

I’m trying to calculate the expenses of the house so I can know how much I’d need to charge to either make a profit (at best) or break even (at worst). 

I’ve watched a couple videos and the most common expenses I’ve seen are:

*Mortgage 

*Property management expenses 

*Property Tax 

*Utilities (wouldn’t this be included in rent?)

*Vacancy (wouldn’t this just be mortgage+property tax+management fees?) Utilities can be cut off during vacancy when nobody’s living on the premises, correct?

*Repairs 

*Gardening 

Details on the house: The kitchen is in a failed renovation state due to my grandad passing away before he could complete it. It’s partially done though. Living room could use some touching up, but nothing too bad. Wood floors everywhere except bedrooms.

I plan on saving as much money as possible to either put a downpayment on the house if she sells it to me, or to put towards renovations if she chooses to give it to me. 

What should I be looking at/doing if I’m seriously considering taking up the house? It’s also in a different state (Atlanta) and I’ve recently moved to Texas. I do plan on traveling back and forth from there though. 

It’s in a nice neighborhood so I think it’d do well. I’m willing to give more information via DM if requested. I want to start talking to her about this, but I’d like to calculate some numbers to see if it’s be profitable."

Smart people will meet new roommates at these and move out into a cheaper whole house. Overall a net positive for the community. Additionally if enough people use this it will drive down rents as it increases rental supply exponentially. This is orginally Airbnb's grass roots."

5232,realestateinvesting,Which scenario makes more sense?,"Hello All,

I am trying to figure out if I am wrong or overthinking this. Earlier this year I sold the previous home that I rented out for a few years because the appreciation of the house just went insane over the last 3 years. It nearly tripled in price and renters were wanting out, because they didn't agree with me increasing the rent by $75/month. It just made a lot of sense to let it go, the value of it just didn't match the rent rates in the area when I did the math on paper. I was only cash flowing around $850 after expenses, so I sold it...plus I was wanting to take a job in another state and move.

Since selling it I have had the proceeds in my Ally Savings until just recently when I moved it over to SCHD @ 67.44 to catch the dividends \~3.25%, which should net me around $3200/Q ($1040/month) in dividend payouts.

I'm currently renting a small apartment near my new job after moving to Florida for $1800/month, but I really dislike this apartment life and already thinking of either buying or renting an actual house in the near future when my lease is up to get a garage again, hate this apartment parking and paper-thin walls BS.

I'm torn between 3 decisions...

1) Does it make more sense to pay cash for a house to avoid the high-interest rates?

or

2) Buy something with a mortgage and keep the cash flow to offset the mortgage cost? (price range I'm looking at mortgages estimate around $2200-2400/month)

or

3) Rent a house and keep the cash flow to offset the rent cost? (seeing houses for rent around $2400/month)"
5233,realestateinvesting,Owner Occupied Loan but Renting Unit,"Hi all,  


So I'm planning on purchasing a duplex under a conventional or FHA owner-occupied loan. The loan terms state I have to occupy the property for at least year.  Now, my parents live nearby and I like staying with them for long periods of time. I get married in 8 months and then I'd be spending 100% of the time living in the duplex.  Until then, I'd rather just be at home with my parents and airbnb the unit until then. 

 Is there a way I lease out the duplex say for STR for some of the time without getting into trouble with the loan? What If I decide to STR only the weekends and live there only during the weekdays?"
5234,realestateinvesting,Cash Out BRRRR during recession,"**Proof:** \[Screenshot-2022-11-23-155356.png\]([https://postimg.cc/DSrCmh4g](https://postimg.cc/DSrCmh4g))

Don't let people or Youtubers dissuade you from investing.  You can still find great deals in today's market with higher interest rates. In fact, the uncertainty and high rates make it easier to find deals as less people are bidding the prices up.

I bought this single family home on the MLS for $80,000. This property had a tenant who was ""2 weeks from moving out"" but they ended up taking 4 months to leave and we had to start the eviction process. Next time, I'll just offer cash for getting out on a specific date that makes sense for everyone.

We spent $25k on the renovation (windows, HVAC, cosmetic rehab). Total investment was $105k. We rented it at $1,395/mo.

The property appraised for $183,000. I refinanced this with two other SFRS with a local bank on a 20 year loan at 5.75%. The mortgage for this one was $119k. If I had to refi at today's rates on a 30 yr loan at 7%, it would produce $3.1k/yr in cashflow.

**The Numbers:**

* $105k Purchase + rehab
* $183k appraised value
* $119k loan at 5.75% on 20 year amortization
* $12k in extra cash at refi
* $64k in equity
* $2.6k in annual cash flow on current loan
* $3.2k in principal pay down
* Appreciation
* Tax Benefits  


**Lessons:**

* Jump on great deals immediately when they go live.
* Build relationships with local lenders and have them compete for you business.
* Don't over-renovate (example, the roof is older but didn't need replacing yet).
* If a tenant is leaving, offer an incentive to help expedite.

  
The refi for this property took place on 10/1/22 when 30 yr mortgages were 6.9% for top tier credit and 20% down. The same bank gave me a term sheet for 6.5% for another set of SFR's this week."

As is, my husband makes around $7-8k/month with his Union job. Maybe more with OT? Husband also has VA disability pay each month which is around 2k/month. Intending to make that around 4k/mont. I’m a senior in college. I graduate next semester and expect to make 60k/year starting out. We have quite a bit saved up, around 40k in liquid assets. Other assets are spread across various investment platforms which I don’t have value of. 

We want to buy this 4-plex. 365k. 2 bedrooms, 1.5 baths in each apartment. Separate utilities, but we would have to pay for water. 2 car garage is added for storage/whatever. Each unit has its own garage. 

Very amazing location. Next to a community college. Super duper safe.

Husband and I are conflicted. Should we use his VA home loan or a FHA loan? We hope to buy more properties in the future. We have an idea of what we’re doing, but my mind is so scrambled rn bc I’m too excited / this opportunity doesn’t feel feel!! Please send advice and tips! Or please direct to where I can learn more!

Seller gets double or triple their asking price over the course of 15-30 years, it is a guaranteed return on investment. Instead of hundreds of thousands in interest going to the bank, it goes straight into the sellers pocket. Buyer doesn’t have to jump through the mortgage hoops.

They inherited it from their dad and they are getting into there 60s and are just done dealing with it. I catch wind of this and basically tell them I would be interested. 

I meet up with the guy who owns it the other night to get a feel for the situation and see how I can get this place. I already know they own the property out-right after looking on the recorders website.... 

Heres where he stands, he wants to sell it but he doesn't want to pay a bunch of money in taxes. So he wants to 1031 the apartment complex into farmland. He is a farmer so that is what he is interested in. The problem he will have is that farmland does not come on the market often so doing a 1031 exchange will be tough for him given the 180 day window. I dont even know if he can exchange from an apartment complex into farmland. 

His cost basis is about 650k and the property is most likely worth 1.5 million today. Built in the 60s, brick exterior, 15 units. Three stories, all two bed one bath, and the electrical has been updated to current ""insurance"" code. 

I have proposed to him seller financing because that will give him visibility on when he would sell letting him get pieces in play for the exchange. I want to do this alone but I obviously dont have a 25% down payment to get commercial financing and I am only 28 which banks dont like youth ha. 

If he rejects seller financing, I think I can fundraise enough money to reach that 25% mark and get some RE vets on the loan to get me financing. 

My question to you all is, how would you play this situation? How can I make a good offer that may be interesting enough he may take it? For simplicity purposes we will say the numbers work out and its a great purchase (if it wasnt a good deal I wouldnt be here asking)"

5289,realestateinvesting,unusual prospective tenant,"Hi all, I just wanted to see if anyone else has had an experience like this. I've posted a property for rent on zillow and marketplace, etc etc, but most of my inquiries come through marketplace. I get several per week they almost always start out with is this available. so I've come up with a canned response about the requirements. 

"" Yes it's still available. I'm looking for 2.5 times the  rent in income, proof required, clear background and eviction history. You're welcome to go walk around it also if you would like.  If you have any other questions let me know! ""

I had a contact this morning who started right off stating he probably makes more money than I do and wanted my phone number  rather than to communicate via messenger. So I gave it to him. 

He called within a couple of minutes and started asking a lot of questions about whether I was the owner or a representative of the owner. I honestly thought he was going to pitch me on some sort of rent to own thing. I'm not interested in that so I challenged him a bit as to why he was asking all of these questions. He immediately suggested that I was being discriminatory based on the sound of his voice. So I explained how I receive a lot of calls about selling the place, and that I'm just looking to rent it out. He again told me how he probably makes more money than ""you or your white friends"".  I never asked about race, nor do I care, but clearly he has made a judgement on mine based on my voice. 

I told him I have friends of all colors and that I'm not interested in discriminating against anyone. I explained that all interested parties will go through the same process which ensures that no one should feel discriminated against. And that I'm just looking for someone who will take care of the place and be consistent about paying the rent. 

Anyway we set up a plan for him to see the house next week, but honestly the whole interaction made me worry that I'm being setup some how. 

I'm just a little taken back by the whole thing. Why would someone care if I'm the owner or not? I'm in FL if that makes any difference at all. 

Thoughts? How do I navigate this without violating his rights, and yet making sure I don't get taken advantage of?"

5297,realestateinvesting,Need Advice - 21 &amp; Looking to Start,"Hey All!

I am a 21 year old living in Wisconsin. I have had interest in rentals since high school and I am looking to start but I am a bit lost. Currently, I own my own condo. I have a mortgage I got in 2021(thankful for the low rate!) and rent out the basement for additional income. I also work fill time and have a decent job and I occasionally make additional side income as well. For the last few years I have saved mostly with a goal of buying a rental. I have an LLC set up for the purpose of buying rentals. My credit is strong and I have a reasonable amount to place as a down payment. 

Here is where I am lost. I had traditionally heard that banks want 20% down, but I have seen an insane amount of variation in my research. My local credit union, who my personal mortgage is though, will not finance in an LLC, requires a minimum of 20% down, requires 6 months of reserves, and will not count any rental or projected rental income towards my debt to income ratio until I steadily get the income for two years. They also will not lock in a rate and it can be increased after year 5, up to 1% a year. I was very uninterested after I heard the long list of what I feel are excessive requirements. Another bank I looked into requires only 10% for a single family, but for a duplex that require 25%. They also will not do it under an LLC but seem overall more willing to do rentals. 

I am hesitant to put an investment property in my personal name. One of my biggest fears is that the life I have built myself could be taken away by some sort of lawsuit and I would be stripped of everything I have worked for. I struggle to understand why each place has a vastly different set of requirements and why it is so seemingly random place to place. 

Ultimately, what do I need to do? How do I go about getting a loan through my LLC? What do I need to be looking for in a bank! And what do I need to expect to have/spend in order to make a rental work? Or am I just simply not going to be able to based on age?

Any and all feedback is appreciated. If I am missing anything or not thinking of something please let me know. I am excited to learn and I look forward to any advice/information that anyone can provide. 

Thanks! - Breck"
5298,realestateinvesting,Can we buy a new house with just a home equity as a down payment?,Hello! I am a newbie here.

5299,realestateinvesting,Using HELOC to purchase first rental property,"I’m looking for advice and/or someone to play devil’s advocate and poke holes in my plan. I am eligible for a $228k HELOC on my primary residence and want to use it to invest in a rental property. The catch is that I already have a second mortgage (used for impact windows and pool) with an outstanding balance of 39k and I would have to pay it off with the HELOC in order to open the HELOC as the bank does not want to be in third position. This would leave me with 189k to invest.  Current quoted rate is at 7.44% and will most likely go up to 8-8.75% as the fed raises rates.  I live in Miami and plan on buying the rental in south Florida as well.  This is a compromise I had to agree to with my wife in order to pursue this endeavor. Now for the plan….

Considering my market is south Florida and I only have 189k to play with, my options are limited. My buy box is restricted to condos with HOAs. Rents here are ridiculously high so it isn’t all bad. 

Option 1 - Buy a property all cash where the rent is enough to pay HELOC, HOA, insurance and taxes.  I know I don’t need insurance if I own the property outright but it’s for peace of mind.  I’m also going to be very picky and find something that meets the 1% rule if possible. Refinance once rates drop. By then I should have enough equity to be able to pay off most of the Heloc if not all of it. 

Option 2 - Use conventional financing putting 25% down with the Heloc money. Once again, rents would be enough to pay PITI and Heloc. Refinance once rates drop and use cash flow towards Heloc. 

It’s also worth mentioning that I’m only throwing out lowball offers on properties that have been sitting on the market for months. I feel like it’s the perfect time to take advantage as fear is starting to set in with the rate increases and recession. I don’t want to miss out an opportunity while there’s blood in the streets. Any thoughts or recommendations would be appreciated."

5302,realestateinvesting,Should I Sell this Rental?,"Looking to get some advice and other perspectives on whether or not I should sell a rental I own.

I had someone reach out to me interested in buying a SFH I own (I'd previously posted for rent and mentioned I'd possibly be interested in selling for the right price).  The home is a small 800sf 2/1 in a rural area.  We just renovated it about 6 months ago.  The potential buyer is aware they would have to honor the lease until expiration.

Potential sales price: $150,000
Current loan balance: $64,000
Rent: $1,200/mo
PITI: $500/mo est
Net cashflow (self managing): ~$470/mo
Net cashflow (with pm): ~$350

On one hand, it seems silly to sell because it's a cash cow and would make this profit (after taxes) in about 5 years if I include mortgage paydown and appreciation (historical average over time).  

At the same time, I've been looking to diversify for a while now.  About 90% of my net worth is in real estate and just about all of it in the same parish (county).  Especially because we're in south Louisiana where hurricanes are a thing and insurance rates have been increasing a lot lately.

Any advice is much appreciated!"

I could probably save this much with 5 more years. However, I feel weird keeping this money in my savings account. It seems a little ridiculous to have that much money wasting away and losing value due to inflation. 

Where should I put this money? Should I put it in a taxable account and buy etfs? In theory the value could go up or down, but if it goes up then I just pay a capital gains tax.

5319,realestateinvesting,MA - Doing my first Cash for Keys proposal and have a couple of questions,"Hi all,

I am located in Massachusetts, and recently purchased two condos that both contain Tenants At Will. They are paying less than half of current market rent, and both units need new kitchens, bathrooms, paint and floors in order to achieve higher rent. I bought the properties using hard money (I frequently use hard money for my flips), and would like to get the current tenants out ASAP, renovate, then refinance with conventional financing.

Since my interest is high due to my current loan product, I'm inclined to pay these tenants off in order to get them out sooner than an eviction would potentially take in MA. One tenant is paying $900, and the other is paying $1100 currently. Market rates are $2000 and $2400 for their units respectively assuming the living conditions would be far superior than they are currently.

Couple questions
1. What's a reasonable amount of money to offer the tenants? I was going to allow them until February 1st 2023 to move out so they have time to move appropriately.

2. Assuming they agree to move out February 1st, do I continue to collect their current rent during this time?

5327,realestateinvesting,Investor proposing seller financing and I have questions - proposal review please,"Man I hope this doesn't turn into a wall of text.  Like many of you I receive insane calls and emails all the time about ""Cash offers"" and like many of you I ignore as many as I can.  One investor got through the spam because his number was close to my boss' number and I answered.  Nice enough gent who made an initial offer about 100k below my ""Cash sale now"" price and I told him such.  He proposed seller financing but hasn't specifically made an offer and so I researched seller financing and it may not be a bad option for me but I wanted to run some proposals by the masses before I go back and give what I believe would be options I can stomach.  

Notes : I'd be thrilled to be rid of these properties.  They aren't cash flowing and I bought on speculation which is doing what I wanted BUT.. i hate people.. so there is that. Very little risk to the properties being destroyed as these are definitely rehab projects.  THIS IS NOT ME ASKING YA'LL TO MESSAGE ME OFFERING ME ANYTHING.   

&amp;#x200B;

He sent me an example of a deal they are running now as a brief example   
650k value - down payment 10k, loan amt 640k, payment 1777 with a 10 year balloon. 

My cash price was 650, with seller financing I think two options make sense to me

700k sales price with 20% down, seller financing 10 year term 

750k sales prices with 10% down, seller financing 10 year term 

700k sales prices with 20% down 5 year balloon 6% interest

750k sales prices with 10% down 5 year balloon 8% interest

&amp;#x200B;

Are these crazy terms for an investor.. maybe I'm just not understanding the process or the ask?  I know I'd need a real estate attorney, title company and I'd get a servicing company.  I intend on writing taxes and insurance are managed by the buyer.  Prior to signing this deal I'd HELOC my primary to pay off the properties in this deal.   10k down to me seems crazy as a seller because I'm taking on risk, process etc.. for just 10k.. with 10% or 20% down the buyer has skin in the game and I have a nice bucket of cash to recover in the event a foreclosure needs to happen.   How would you propose this type of deal?  

&amp;#x200B;

If it helps -- property valuation

4 doors, 1 duplex and 2 SFHs.  2 properties will require anywhere from 70-100k in renovation, one will probably need 10-15 to make it top notch.  They are all right next to each other in a gentrifying area in the city center."

I'm selling properties in some HCOL areas and trying to buy in a VHCOL area that has very limited amount of real estate available.  Basically it means I need to jump on a purchase aggressively when something comes up but it's difficult to line up a sale that meets the 1031 requirements on the other end because of renter issues etc.  I'm pulling one off now but it's a lot more work and sleepless nights than I want to deal with in the future.  It seems so arbitrary that a hiccup in closing or some minor technical issue could bump you out of your date restrictions and nail you with capital gains tax.  Or is this just how it works all the time?

I've got more to sell but I could see it taking a year or more.  I'm looking into Delaware Trusts that I can invest in over time then cash out all at once future date but I'm not feeling super secure about dumping that much into someone else's projects that I don't have any control over.

If I don't go this route I will end up selling mutiple properties at once to roll into one 1031 exchange and have a lot more sleepless nights in my future."

The VA has something about a 144k limit being lifted and then says the limit is the same as FHA?

So what happens if you have a VA loan for a 300k house and then you go to another house hack that’s 300k? Do you just have to use a conventional? Is there a way to use the rest of your VA entitlement for 200k and then 100k of a conventional?

 I don’t want to put zero down on my first buy because I have some cash and the numbers are brutal without a down payment. But if I do move on to another house hack in a year or two, would I then need to get a conventional? I might not have enough to put a full 20% down with closing costs that quickly.

My girlfriend and I are trying to get a $250,000 FHA loan for a duplex to house hack. We didn't think it would be any issues at all because combined we make enough for that loan amount. After going through the process for pre approval today with a Mortgage banker for home loans they said since my income is a national fellowship stipend it cannot be counted AND my secondary source of income that I've had for 4 months also CANNOT be counted. This made only my girlfriend's income be eligible leaving us pre approved for $200,000, which is very disappointing and discouraging since there are very little duplexes in our area especially ones we'd want to live in for $200,00. This was a dream of ours for so long and any help or insight would be appreciated.

We purchased the large lot property 25-30% below market value, and this is complicating the depreciation calculation.  Purchased in 2022 a 36 unit duplex community for $5.4m (Market value is $7.65m and county tax report FMV of $7.23m). The county tax report showed the land value at 22% of the total value (seems about right). I get I have to base the depreciation off the purchase price and not FMV, so I used this 22% land value off the purchase price to figure the remaining improvements. Then I did a cost segregation study to break out the structure (27.5 yr straight line), land improvements, building improvements &amp; personal property like carpet, cabinets, appliances (5yr) to figure the special bonus depreciation amounts below.  My CPA is not sure what to do and don’t want red flag the IRS. Maybe I should reduce the bonus depreciation 25% to reflect the below market price paid? Thanks

$5,400,000 - purchase price
$1,188,000 - Land value (22%)
$2,013,696 - Structure improvements (27.5 yr st. Line)
$1,162,350 - Building improvements (bonus depreciation)
 $ 951,570 - Land improvements (bonus depreciation)

5396,realestateinvesting,Current landlord remodeling but may not have permits. Could we leverage this in us buying this property?,"We are current tenants in a 4plex. Our landlord is doing remodeling on the bottom two vacant units due to a water leak. This has since been found and “fixed”. 

We have talked about buying this place as this property may also likely include a single bedroom home that sits in the back yard on the same property square. (How it was sold before) We would use that as our residence and rent out the 4plex.

During this repair we noticed that no permit is visible and they had to reroute new plumbing from the water heater to the other two apartments. FYI, the bottom apartment line actually feeds water to the upper apartments. As we lost water during the leak investigation and replumbing.

During the replumbing they went through the wall. Some may be support? They also cut a large chunk of wall to make a breakfast bar to the kitchen. This wall is also a main middle wall but don’t know about it being a support.

Could we leverage a lack of permit if they didn’t get one during a buying process to ultimately lower the home value?

Location is Denver. I think the last time it sold to these people it was $600k a few years ago. So with todays market we’re probably at $800k now for both 4plex and single family home. We could rent out each for $1500 as is. Full remodel could easily be $1800-$2000. All four units are 2b 1bath. My income is $90k, fiancé is part time but would take over managing the apartment if we buy. That’s were our heads are. We never owned a rental but think this would be an avenue we can go down."

Should I be amortizing while I can afford it? Should I wait for inflation to hit hard and salaries rise (therefore I will be making a bigger amount of money and mortgage won't be so ""heavy"" on my finances).

I just completed a big remodel on a 4-plex and it just hit the market. I used a 20’ shipping container to store materials and I figured the container into the cost of the renovation. There isn’t any storage outside the actual units. 

My question is: 
Is it worth it to convert the shipping container in to on site mini storage? To clarify, I plan to keep a section for on site maintenance and two or three other 5x8 lockers for tenant use. I would charge them separately from rent and let the property management company handle that. Also, do those of you who have something similar have any advice on this?

Benefits that I can see:
An extra 200-ish in cash flow from an asset I already have on site. Numbers are  based on similar sized outdoor mini storage units in the area. I do t have to move the container off site. Return on investment for the conversion is 10 months or so at the assumed rental price. I have storage on site for maintenance items. Also, it’s not visible from the road or front of property. It has zero overhead cost aside from property management fees. 

Downsides: 
It does take up some space in the parking area. I’m sure it will be abused.

5431,realestateinvesting,Selling an investment property - Looking for opinions,"We have a duplex, and are looking to sell it sometime in the next 4 months. 

We had both sides vacant a few months ago and got very lucky with a desperation tenant who wasn't financially bound and paid premium ($2,800/mo for 12-months) to move in ASAP. We have ridden the real estate slump on the other unit since then, and now the other side still sits vacant, listed at $2,300/mo with moderate interest and showings.

Since we plan to sell either way, we are considering selling it with a vacant side. The pros: the property will show at it's max potential ($2,800 income per side - even though the market has slipped since it fetched that rate), and could also be lived in by a family with a very low mortgage, given the large off-set by the occupied income from the other unit. The cons: the property may not appraise as high given it is only actively leased on one side and therefore can't be assumed to generate rent on the other side. Also, if a pure investor is looking at the property simply for cash flow, they may see the vacancy as a negative in needing to find more tenants immediately. 

Will it sell for more fully occupied at $2,800 + $2,300 ($5,100/month) which indicates the true value is somewhere in between those 2, or half-occupied at $2,800 / month leaving it more open ended on what the other side would fetch and the possibility of someone to live in it at a steeply discounted mortgage?

5435,realestateinvesting,How do you decide whether or not to sell a property?,"My assets are heavily weighted in real estate so I'm thinking of selling a house and putting the equity (after taxes and transaction fees) into low cost index funds.

The math seems to indicate that it's about the same. The property cash flows and in the end I can sell the asset. However, with an index fund, I can withdraw about the same amount of cash from in and the principal will still grow, assuming an 8% return.

Is there an analysis methodology I should look into for comparing the two investments?

The hardest part is that I can't accurately predict what stock market returns will be, obviously no one can. I use 8% because it seems reasonable but who knows. I feel a little bit more confident about what the appreciation on the house because of where it's located.

Any advice or suggestions?"

5449,realestateinvesting,Thoughts on Multifamily Properties,"Hello! I am wanting to buy a multifamily property for house hacking in the greater Phoenix area within the next 6-12 months. I have started trying to educate myself on real estate investing but have found that ""finding deals"" in this market has been challenging. I've only been analyzing properties on Zillow (and similar websites), but most properties have significant negative cash flows per month accounting for expenses. Some properties have documents put together by their real estate agent marketing 5%+ cap rates, but their ""expenses"" don't account for vacancy/cap-ex etc. 

This may be an obvious question, but are all the deals for multifamily properties currently available on the MLS bad in terms of cash flow? Should my goal for purchasing a property right now be to simply avoid negative cash flows, and when interest rates go down to refinance later?

Any advice is truly appreciated! Thank you!"

5461,realestateinvesting,What is the best way for me to Leverage my small real estate property to buy a Primary Home for my Family?,"We are a couple (27M, &amp; 24F ) and About 3 years ago, I purchased a small townhouse for about $30,000 with cash in a LCOL place. I put in about $7,000 worth of repairs and rented it. Ever since then, I have been collecting rent from the place and has helped me and family a lot. This property was bought in a state (PA) different to the the one I was living and currently live (NYC). So basically I am renting an apartment in one city, while my property is rented and located in another one.
Fast Forward to 2022, we have come to a point in which we would like to find a way to move from New York to PA. I have moved up with my company into a middle management role. Due to this, I am able to work remotely indefinitely, so I can keep my NYC salary and work from somewhere else. I will only be required to take maybe quarterly trips to the city.
These are my stats for a better understanding of my situation:
INCOME
Household Annual Salary : 75K Gross (About $4750 Net/Month) (Wife is studying and does not work)
Real estate income : 9.6K Net/Year
Total Monthly Net Income = $5,550
ASSETS
Value of the property : 68K - 72K (According to Redfin/Zestimate; I don’t owe anything on it. No mortgage associated with it.)
401K : $6,000
Brokerage: $7,000
Cash : $15,000 (Will jump to 20K End of Year after Bonuses)
LIABILITIES
Federal Student Loans = 46K (6% annual interest)
EXPENSES
Real Estate expenses : 5K Net Annually ( Renters insurance/Taxes/Trash/Water)
Total Monthly Net Expenses: About $3,000 all Bills (Rent/Real estate Expenses/ StudentLoans/ Etc) [Not Counting Miscellaneous expenses]
The main issue for me is that I want a home in the 225K - 250K range. And given that I am no longer a first time home buyer, I would have to put 20% down which at this range would be somewhere around 45K-55K . This is not easily obtainable. Not only that, but interest rates are incredibly high at the moment. I can find places in PA cheaper than this, but I would not want to do that given that the entire reason for this is to live in a calmer/safer environment and be able to raise children. I am trying to find a way for us to try and get a primary home, but I seem to get nowhere. If I try to sell the house, I would get destroyed with taxes. I can't refinance a mortgage since I don't have one. I tried to look into HELOC, but those interests are like 9%; and it would be hard to get a HELOC on a property anyways. Living in the rental property is absolutely not an option for us. We don't like the neighborhood or the city that is in anymore. Any ideas on this situation?"

5463,realestateinvesting,Bought 6 houses from auction ~ 3 month update,"I made a post 3 months ago about buying 6 homes from the auction. I deleted the post because I was getting too many messages and I didn't have time to get back to everyone. The main question/concern everybody had was about the redemption rights. The redemption rights allow the owners of the house 6-12 months to buy their house back after they lose it. There are 2 different types of auctions. First is Sheriff sales (Bank Foreclosure Auction) and the second is Tax Foreclosure auction. The auction I bought these houses were from a Tax Foreclosure auction. The redemption period is over before the houses even get listed. One of the clerks told me the redemption period ended in March 2022. The houses then get put on auction and once you get the deed they are all yours no questions asked. 

Pros of auction - Houses are much much cheaper, less paperwork (takes 3 minutes). 

Cons of auction - Have to pay full amount in cash same day, owners still living in them (not all of them), don't know anything about the condition inside the homes, houses usually need a lot of work if vacant.

3 of my houses will be ready by the end of the year. The other three by Feb-March time. 

The rental prices will range from $1200-1400. I will expect around $7,2000 a month once all ready. No mortgage, tax already paid in the auction price.

Spent the last 6 years renovating it myself so I could learn the skills and because I enjoyed the work. Replaced every single component of the house except the framing. House is really nice now and worth about $480K before the Fed jacked up rates. My neighbor bought his house (same size/style as mine pre-reno) for $440K in January of this year. I was thrilled to see that price. Met with a realtor yesterday that suggested listing mine at $399K. I was pretty bummed to hear this. I owe about $80K in debt (CC’s, HELOC) from the renovation ($300K all-in) and have been wanting to move to the PNW for a couple years with my S.O. My plan was to sell for $450K-$480K and buy another fixer up there. My current interest rate is 3.3%. But if I can only get $400K, it doesn’t make as much sense given rates are now 7%. Feeling a little stuck and wishing I just sold my house for the same price my neighbor bought his even though mine is much nicer/newer.

I would be using a heloc (60k). So I would put 20 down, repair and then refinance for an ~arv of 160k. I would then pay off heloc.

Evening,

I currently live in Miami, FL.

There are condominiums like The Blue/Green Diamond Condominiums, The Akoya, Mei, and many other Condominiums Located here in Miami, and I always wonder what the process is of building and funding these structures.


I am looking to start up a business where we build these types of structures, so in my mind would you have to make a company that does construction, or get in partnership with a company who does construction? These are the types of questions that are being asked daily throughout my mind. Are there people who come together and fund these structures? Do I need a real estate biz to start a project like this? I'm Not quite sure on where you would start, but when I see skyscrapers it motivates me to build one.

A buy-and-hold landlord with four properties, bought in the 90s and early 2000s, mentioned one of his properties was bought for $55k. He put $50k in rehab.  He did not expect to make any money off it when he bought it. (He has never done owner-occupied either.) From lacking specifics, I don't know if it was a bad deal--but it sure sounds like it!  

I recently saw a bad SFH wholesale with seller-financing: 7% interest rate, ten year balloon, 10% down. Monthly payments around $2400. Estimated rent $1600.  The first year, they would be paying over $20k in interest (and only get about $9k in equity). The buyer would bleed about $1000/month until they can refi.

Right now my plan is to pay an ADU subject matter expert to do a consultation on the property before taking any next steps. I am hoping this can yield an answer on if these ADUs will be permittable. If they can be made legal, and I can get the place at the right cost, I don't see any reason to not continue forward with the deal.

If you were in my shoes, what questions would you be trying to answer before moving forward with the deal? Are there any major concerns that come to mind?"

Looking into buying a small 4 unit apartment building in Monterrey Mexico. I am a dual citizen living in US. My relatives would take care of managing the rental property. She is a real estate agent, so she knows the area well and what will/won't do well. We feel it is a low entry cost and not substantial, but decent enough profits to be worth it. Question is - not sure how passive income / transferring money to US will be taxed. As I understand it, up to 10k is taxed same as regular income federally. 

We are looking at my relative ""gifting"" me low sums of money regularly. I'd have a bank account in mexico and here, and would transfer every few months when a certain amount adds up. Any other ways to reinvest the profits in US as soon as they arrive to avoid taxing? Other thoughts/experinece?"
5545,realestateinvesting,Question re: House Hacking vs LTR,"Been quietly reading this sub for awhile, and would love perspective from others more experienced. Am based in Northern California, not Bay Area but still pretty high COL compared to most of the country. As such, renting by the room definitely has the potential to be profitable in the right scenarios. 

Currently own one LTR (it was originally our primary, and we still have the ability to sell until 6/30/24 and pay no taxes on the gain). Mortgage + solar = \~$2,040/mo against rent of $2,800, so very solidly cash-flow positive. However, if we sell we can take \~245k post-commissions/closing costs in equity. In that scenario, I would put $100k down on a 4/3 nearby listed at $415k and end up with a mortgage around $2,700/mo against rental income of \~$3,800/mo (could rent master for \~$1,200, second bedroom w/ own bath for \~$1,000/mo and the remaining two bedrooms w/ shared bathroom for \~$800/mo each). I do know for a fact that renting by the room is very easy to do here, with a plethora of renters in the price ranges mentioned above. 

Would increase my cash flow by \~$340/mo, while also giving us \~$145k in cash (and the potential to buy a second in a similar situation, should the first go well). Obviously on paper and solely looking at the numbers, it makes sense. My question for the more experienced investors is - what am I missing? I would be self-managing the rental/renters. Any feedback/guidance would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!"

5547,realestateinvesting,Is buying a property in Maui a wise investment??,"So I’m not experienced in real estate investment at all but I have fairly good intuition in general. My parents (Boomers of course) have notoriously make unsound financial decisions. 

They recently sold their Bay Area home and have left over equity as well as came into inheritance from my grandparents. 

As a result, they want to invest in real estate to have cash flow income for their retirement and to leave to my sister and I. 

They are obsessed with ‘Maui’ and want to buy a property there. I told them I don’t think this is a wise investment due to inflated property values in that area, intense rental competition between other renters, Airbnbs, and the disgruntled Hawaiian’s increased regulation requirements on short term rentals. 

What do you think? Am I right or wrong? Are there better markets for a long term investment with higher ROI worth investing their money into? Please advise.

In my country (Eastern Europe) the rent vary from 250euro up to 1000euro a month.

I mean It can pay off my investment in furniture, but it needs 26months and then I will be receiving 'free' money from it. 

The price I will spend isn't gonna make my flat look and feel  'luxurious' but more of a 'modern' and fairly average for todays era.

5551,realestateinvesting,2 door lakeside VR nearing completion... thoughts for step 2?,"Hey everybody,

Last year I purchased 5+ acres of gorgeous lakefront land in upper Wisconsin. A small 1 bedroom cabin with full kitchen / bath + loft was completed in late winter 2021. Since then, a larger 3 bedroom walkout basement home was worked on, and should be finished by EOY. 

Estimated value will be about $750,000. It will be completely paid in full. Right now the only bills are electric, internet, and LP. About $200 / month.

I'm signing a full service management company contract this week that'll take 23% for full service. I've got 1-2 years of savings to focus full time on getting this off the ground the right way.

This is largely a summer boom for rentals, but snow-mobile trails do bring in business in the winter time. 12 weeks should be extreme easy mode, and shoulder seasons should do okay. That being said, I'm keeping my estimates low for the first year.

Year 1 I'm thinking 14 weeks of rentals on each would be very doable, which would be about $68,000 gross.

Year 2 we hope to near 20 weeks, which would crack the $100,000 mark.

I've estimated after taxes, management fees, repairs, gas, electric, internet, snow removal, the works to be, at most, 70%, to bring net to $30,000.

I'd say there are a few good options, but I'd love some input.

Option 1 : Build 2 more small 1 bedroom rentals on the property, capping out the 4 homes allotted for this plot without a hotel rental. They could be fully built out and furnished for less than $100k. This would beef up the same property, probably near the $150-$175K yearly mark.

Option 2 : Let the rentals iron themselves out, go get a decent full-time job in Chicago, and get to year 2 so I can talk borrowing options. Borrow against any side of income or property value itself, and seek a totally separate market like Florida.

I'm in a very unique position to have step 1 be totally paid for. Just curious what people think might be a good second step to strive for within the next 2-3 years.

Cheers!"

5587,realestateinvesting,"Questions, as thinking of renting my starter home for income.","Hello! New to this sub, but have always studied investing and such.

I have a few question as I’ve been interested in possibly renting out my home.

The facts:

I bought a single family home in the Tampa Bay area in 2016 (twenty minutes outside of the city).

I bought at $144k with a loan of $114k, which the balance is now $93k. Mortgage payment is now $850 a month, just went up $100 due to taxes/insurance.

The area is currently going through a population boom. Tons of new houses $400,000 and up, in HOA subdivisions.

It’s a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 1 car garage home; built in 2003. This home has a quarterly HOA fee of $150 (has community center).

I’ve put a new roof on it, new AC, and thinking about updating appliances as I believe they are original - refrigerator, stove, dishwasher.

The home in a sense would easily be considered “move in ready”.

I have the ability to move “home” with a parent which would allow me to rent out my home.

I’m not a handyman in anyway, so any fixing of anything broken around the home would have to be done by a professional. Anything broken by tenants would be paid by tenants.

I’d be looking at using a property management company to collect rent and manage the property - although I would also be active in making sure things are taken care of.

My questions:

What do you see as the pros and cons of the situation (besides moving home)?

Is the situation worth it, given I would lose the Homestead Exemption on my property? Tax assessed value is $104,616, and the exempt $50,000 of value helps keep the mortgage down.

I’d want to make sure the price of rent stay above what I’d owe monthly on the mortgage.

My goal is to sock money away into savings and eventually be able to secure enough for a down payment on a second home which would be my primary.

Looking for any feedback, and if you have any questions I’d definitely provide more details."

5597,realestateinvesting,Update Regarding My Last Thread Here (Getting My First Rent Check),"Hi there! I posted a thread here (https://old.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/uxvaqn/i_got_my_first_rent_checks_today/) five months ago, and I wanted to post an update here as it has been a trip. I'm on mobile, so apologies for any formatting issues. 

So my first tenant was very odd - she wouldn't let my property manager into the unit to do repairs, so we had to evict her after a month of non payment. It did cost me about $600 in lawyer's fees to file the paperwork, but the tenant did not damage anything and did vacate the unit, plus I got to keep her security deposit, so I did get 2-3 months of rent at $1350.

From there, I'd say it took another month to find a tenant. We had to reduce rent to $1300 a month from $1350 but it got done. The most bothersome thing about all of this is my property manager insists on screening applicants with pets when I insist on ones without them. Also, I got a notice saying there was lead paint on my unit on my unit (can't be much because there's vinyl siding on the exterior walls) but a month later I got another notice saying there's nothing wrong, and we didn't do anything to the unit in the interim. (I'm busy moving and didn't get the letter for some time.)

I did do the math on my unit when calculating ROI at $1100 a month, so I'm still okay, but it was a bumpier path than expected. Assuming no more complications, I should still have a decent ROI, but I'm posting this to illustrate that real estate does require effort and is not some get rich quick scheme. Also, I know there are people who have had much worse tenants, so I am grateful that my problem tenant was gone relatively quickly. 

Regarding my property manager, I think he's honest, but also requires a lot of handholding. Would I invest in a non local property again? Probably not. Am I keeping the one I have now? Yes, because I do make money, I'd lose money if I sold now and I think there's room for appreciation in the place I bought in.

Good luck to everyone here, thanks for reading this!"

I’m not an expert on commercial RE, but I see an opportunity that I think is good and I’d like some help.

I curious as to what I can ask for in terms of diligence. Ideally I’d like to examine the financial health of the tenants/businesses in place. 

Am I able to ask for the:
1. Cost of utilities.
2. A breakdown of each lease and what the tenants cover.
3. Analyze the financial health of the tenants.

These tenants are paying a NNN lease. I know this covers maintenance, but to what extent? Are they responsible for replacing a roof or fixing the heating/cooling system? 

For those of you that have experience with commercial retail space, please give me some advice and things to look for when analyzing this deal.

Lastly, do RE agents typically get a commission for aiding in the purchase of commercial RE? I’m an agent and would represent myself, so I’m wondering if I would be able to get a cut and how much that cut would be."

5626,realestateinvesting,Keep or sell commercial property,"Rural small (&lt;2000 pop) town (Midwest)

2 story 2400 sq ft commercial property (commercial main level and a 3 bdr, 2 bath residential apartment on 2nd floor)

$500-$600 monthly expenses 

$60,000 owed @ 7%, making $500/mo interest only payments 

$1200 potential rent for apartment

$0-$7000+ potential business profit for commercial space. Or $500/mo in rent. 

$70,000 personal consumer debt we need to pay off 

$150,000-$200,000 estimated sale price

——

We own a 100+-year-old commercial property in main street in our tiny (&lt;2000 pop) home town. Lower level is 1200 sq ft of commercial space and the upper level is a 1200 sq ft 3 bdr/2ba apartment. Both levels are newly renovated with restored hardwood, tiled bathrooms, new kitchen, etc. It’s a beautiful space. 

Our original dream was to open a shop on the first floor and live upstairs. Then COVID hit, we had another baby, and we found ourselves in a season where our business venture would no longer be worth the time and energy of running it for many reasons and we also needing a different living situation. We bought a house in the same town. The plan was to rent the apartment for about $1200/mo and use the main level as a space for my much less time/energy intensive part-time business. 

We are now debating just selling the building altogether, but we worry about regretting it in the future due to loss of rental income and business income. We have a lot of debt though and selling would allow us to pay the worst of it off. How can we make the best decision? 

We have a $60,000 personal loan for the building purchase and renovation, paying $500/month but ideally we would pay it off with another loan as it’s from a family member and was meant to be short term. We haven’t had luck securing other financing because of the type of property. 

We have $70,000 in credit card debt that we desperately want to pay off. A lot of it is from renovation expenses that we expected to get paid off with our original business plan that didn’t get off the floor. 

Monthly expenses for the building (utilities, taxes, insurance) are around $500/mo. 

We could rent out the apartment for $1200/mo. I worry about renters trashing the place and hate the thought of being a landlord. We did it for 9 years and don’t love it. 

My potential profit from using the first level could be between $1000-$7000 - it really would depend on the level of effort and time I’m willing to put into it. I’m not sure I’m in a season of life to go all out to be honest (homeschooling kids and having babies/toddlers to care for). It could become more likely to reach the higher end of profit in 3-4 years. 

If we sell, we could expect to sell for $150,000-$200,000 (our rough estimate).  We could pay off our debt and save $2500/month on what we’re making in debt payments. But we also lose out on the future income potential. There aren’t many commercial properties in our small town, and our property is very unique, well preserved, and would fit our dream business down the road."

5632,realestateinvesting,Sell or develop,"Sorry for the novel.

I currently own 2 rental properties.

One is a piece of a shopping center. The shopping center is pretty old and it was purchased for a good deal. I initially had to put a good amount of cash into it in order to value add and get better leases. I have finally broke even on my additional cash and the property is currently cash flow positive. The neighborhood is 30 min from city center and generally low income for Southern California. Value of prop based on noi and similar props is about 1.3M.

The second prop is 4 unit bungalow style property 7k sq ft lot. I have pretty low rents compared to the area mostly to keep my good tenants. 3 my tenants have lived here for 4+ years and I live in the back unit. This property is cash flow even but I live in a unit without making any contribution from my pocket. Property value is about 1.6-1.8M.

Family Finances:

My parents live of the property income and retirement which amounts to about 120k a year. (Would prefer not to ask them for any money)

I currently have corporate job which requires a lot of hours. I make a base of 215k plus 15-30k bonus depending on the year.

I have one sister who is still in school.

Question:

Option 1:

The second property is in a neighborhood that is undergoing a lot of development. Within 3 blocks of me there has been an addition of 500 units (some still under construction). I have been contacted a number of times with offers to purchase my property for around 1.8m. So that is option 1.

Option 2:  
Would be me trying to 1031+boot the shopping center into a lot next to mine and then finding a developer to partner with and develop my lots (14k lot size). I have no experience doing anything like that and it honestly scares me a little. I am not risk averse but do not have a lot of savings (however I estimate that I can save about 80-100k going forward). If anyone has any idea how much this would cost or any experience doing anything similar.

Option 3 would be to develop only my lot I have done rough math on this and it would require (at least) a 4.5m construction loan. Utilizing the proper density bonuses I am zoned for roughly 40 units. The loan 100k a unit construction cost (idk how accurate this is). I estimate take home rent per unit would be 1800.

Any advice would be useful I want to make a game plan so that I can properly budget the next couple years in order to best set up my family for the future. The goal is to have enough passive income to not have to really stress."
5633,realestateinvesting,Tax Deed Sale Question,"Hi,

In June 2022 I bid and won a property through a tax deed auction in CA for what I thought was land and a mobile home on it. The listing had from the auction site said it had a Land Value of $43,835 and Structural Improvements of $34,148, I acquired it for $26,100. 

Although I won the property in 6/1/2022, the actual deed was transferred to my name on 8/31/22. I went to secure the property on 9/5/22 and it actually had an active alarm and was fully furnished, but looked abandoned for quite awhile. 

Long story short, I found out the previous owner had died, but the daughter was still paying the electricity and after I was able to make contact with her she told me she wanted to retire on the property.

The problem now lies in that I realized when trying to research to rent the property to her, that I probably should get mobile home insurance, but the title of the mobile home was actually still in her mom's name and that the mobile home was not on a permanent foundation, therefore was not actually part of the property even though on the County Property Tax bill it says the assessed value is has a Land Value of $43,835 and Structural Improvements of $34,148 with a property tax bill of $845.20.

I also found out that in CA, there are two ways mobile homes can be taxed: 1) either through HUD or 2) can be combined with the land assessment even if NOT on permanent foundation. My situation is the later.

I contacted HUD and they said I would need a release from the current owner, but she passed away or a have the heir of the deceased owner (the daughter) sign the release. Also to attach the Death Certificate and Certificate for Transfer Without Probate Form together with the other forms if the owners has passed away.

The property has 3 main big issues: 1) there is low to none water pressure, a handy man said it due to the galvanized pipe that needs to fixed, but still waiting on quote. 2) one side of the mobile home needs to leveled. 3) The deck and or stairs needs fixing

Given my situation, I can't get mobile insurance for the mobile home without transferring the title.  I can either not say anything to the daughter and just pay to fix everything and rent as is without mobile home insurance. Or if I can ask her to get the title transferred over, but I doubt she would want to transfer to my name- but just have it transferred to her name and I was thinking of just renting the land to her. 

If I rent the land to her who would be responsible for the water pipe issue, mobile home leveling or anything like the deck or back stairs needs repairing? 

I'm not sure how to proceed or what's the best course of action? ANY advice would be greatly appreciated. TIA!"

I live in the Netherlands and I was able to buy my first home last year for €220k all inclusive, and I have now put €40k for renovation (mostly to make it energy efficient).

Although the interest rates have sky rocketed, I was wondering if it will be better to buy a second home for renting in the next 6 months - 1 year or just hold on to the cash. Let’s say if a similar home costs €210k, since it’s for renting I’ll have to pay 8% transfer tax (which was 0 for my first home) and will only get up to 80% mortgage. That means I’ll have to put at least around €65-70k as down payment. Also, I wouldn’t probably renovate it too much but let’s say I will have to put €8-10k. I will be renting it out for around €1200 a month, and after taxes and mortgage I will I will probably next min €200 to max €300. Will it be worth the investment?"

My agent keeps telling me I can use the losses, depreciation and interest to offset the revenue on my other properties and my day job income.

I hope to pay the property off in 2 years tops.

Has anyone else used a money losing property to offset revenue?"
5645,realestateinvesting,debating buying a rental property in college.,"I'm a recently 19 year old male who's looking at buying his first property, ideally a duplex. I go to college part time and I will finish my bachelors in 3 years for free (thank you us government and my grades) and even get paid for it while also clearing about $3250 after tax a month. I have $38k in cash and I have $12k in debt on my car that is worth $20k. I still have 3 years of college in the same town I live at now and I plan to work here after college. My options right now are 3 properties all around $130k-$160k that are duplexes that rent out for around $700-$950 a side  a month. I also have a friend who would live with me on my side of the duplex. If I had both paying it would only be about $100 for me to make the mortgage including insurance and tax. I have a 740 credit score and I can use an FHA loan for this property, just wondering if I'm biting off more than I can chew? I don't know if im getting myself into some crazy expenses buying a house made 50-60 years ago? I would love to know of any expenses that I should expect."

Hi all, thank you so much for helping if you can.
My daughter's partner contractor, wife, and ex boyfriend went
into partnership with my daughter in
a duplex house next door to the contractor and wife. First the
contractor and his lawyer wrote a very badly
written contract that left every situation ""to Be
discussed"" because he was such a ""nice guy""
but that nice guy is already trying to get
additional money from my daughter. He
installed a motorized gate without asking, new
concrete driveway, ADU plumbing and
electrical, not complete electrical because they
have to bring more power from the street and
add a pole. Expensive. He wants to add a new
roof and gave her samples to pick out the color!
Without ever giving the cost. He now wants her
to pay for the ADU changes to the garage. She
sent him a spreadsheet in early October to fill
out with estimated costs. Hasn't done it. She
went to meet with him yesterday to see the
progress on the house, very slow. He
convinced her to go to his office, instead of the
site, to work on the spreadsheet. He then said
he hadn't seen the spreadsheet. It was in his
email October 6th. He agreed to bring the
duplex up to habitable state. He would take the front unit back to rent and she would live in the back, not sure she can
afford to do that now. He agreed to pay for all
repairs and improvements to bring it to the
habitable state. My daughter hired a lawyer to
write the contract and finally got that signed,
but lots of stress trying to work out the details.
Her ex boyfriend still retains 1% ownership until
they can refinance within the next year and a
half now. Interest rates have more than
doubled. The contractor and his wife own 49%
of the property. My daughter owns 50%. I went
with my daughter one night to look at the
property while they were still working on the
partnership contract, and we went over to their
house to discuss the details of the original
contract. He snuck into the discussion that he
wanted her to pay for the side concrete, fence,
and landscaping. She said she couldn't afford it
and he spoke to her and to me angrily when we
asked questions. Quick one liners. So several
months later, he put in the driveway and a
motorized gate without asking her! She thought
he had done it and was going to pay for it since
he never asked her again and they clearly wrote
in the contract that any additional changes had
to be in writing. He also banned me from future
meetings because his wife and I spoke too
loudly at the kitchen table. I was in shock
because he had spoken to me sneeringly and to
my daughter when we asked about the
additional charges for the outdoor concrete and
fence. He had spoken as though he were going
to pay for all of that in a previous conversation
where I was also present. He spoke angrily
again to my daughter in a meeting alone with
her after that, so we know it wasn't just me that was the target. He wanted her to hurry up and sign the contract but he hadn’t reviewed it. When he finally did look at it, he made some changes! Now he wants to loan
her the money to be paid back whenever she
can, within the next few years. She is up to her
eyeballs in debt as it is and is supposed to
refinance the loan in the next 18 months or less.
The duplex is not done. They need to finish the
interior, drywall, flooring, fixtures and stucco
the outside to finish what he originally agreed
to do. The contractor partner wants to replace
the roof while it's still under construction. It
does have some week points, can't remember
what. It's old. The concern is that the couple
might harm my daughter's reputation amongst
the community there and/or do sometl V, to
the duplex to harm it, or her, in some way. The
contractor has been actively talking to the ex
boyfriend, we think to figure out how to best
get the money out of my daughter.
Any words of advice would be much
appreciated. Thank you. My daughter is trying
to rebuild her life after a terrible breakup and
was hoping to make some new friends in this
cute little town inland from the California coast,
but I am concerned that the cost is increasing
for this duplex and the contractor is a
manipulative bully, but presents this nice guy
image around town. How can my daughter deal
with this guy and still get the duplex done with
her new hometown intact, or should she refuse
to give him any more money and not take the
loan and say that she will pay him Back when
she can? Or not pay him back anything since he
did this work without her consent?
Thank you in advance."

5666,realestateinvesting,Deal Structure: Capital provided by one partner out of state to an active REI Couple,"Hi - i am looking to suggest a partnership to a couple that are active in REI out of my state. They are friends of ours. I am very impressed with their skillset and i like investing in people that i find impressive.

One is a Real Estate Agent and the other renovates and rehabs their properties full time. They just finished a rehab and sale and the quality of work was amazing.

I am looking to suggest a partnership; as one thing they are missing is capital. 

My idea was to

1. Form an LLC where i would own 30%
2. Help evaluate deals
3. provide capital to buy and rehab properties and charge 15 yr mortgage rate interest on the money with no money down from other partner
4. keep 30% of the upside for rehab and sale
5. if buy and hold strategy, set aside 10% for vacancy, 10% for capex/maintenance and balance of cash flow after expenses split 70/30

Question is how to value the work done by the rehab partner that is fair but also provides me a suitable return as they will be capturing 70% of the upside for the work they are doing.

This is just percolating in my brain right now, i haven't suggested anything. They know me as a successful businessperson/business investor with access to capital and with a knowledge of real estate but havent suggested anything to me.

Probably they don't need me, and can build with other hard money, but i think doing something like this with people that are high quality can be quite fun and enjoyable.

Am I overvaluing myself? undervaluing myself? - i don't anticipate bringing anything other than cash and a sounding board."

We live in a modern world that has a lot of other tech and things to get into other than just you know residential fix and flips or renting out bare bones properties.  I feel like that’s an ancient business model


So my question is, where did this idea of easy real estate success being easy come from?

But maybe I’m wrong and it is actually easy compared to other business or investments?

**Should I invest in Real Estate right now?**

* It depends what you want your real estate investment to do. 
* It’s an excellent time for market mitigation, cash flow, and maintaining upside.
* It’s a terrible time to house-hack, BRRR, and 10X
* You can no longer rely on refinancing or exiting your way into larger/more properties
* If you can hold, however, you have an excellent mid-long-term outlook 

**Should I be worried about my multifamily assets?**

* Not if you are like the majority of people on this sub who operate assets directly or aspire to someday. 
* If you have a stable model, you can hold and wait out any slowed rental growth and/or lowered valuations.
*  If you are institutional or aggressive investor where you outsource, focus on growth, and have interest coming due, however, you may need to be prepared to put up cash or be forced into a sale.

**But what if debt keeps increasing?**

* There is a  limit to the effect of debt can have on multifamily valuations. For example, if the debt rate went to 15%, would a multifamily asset only sell for a 15% cap+ (meaning a 15%+ return per year if purchased with all cash)? Of course not.  There are always non-debt buyers who would be happy to take a 15% or even 10% yearly cash flow at a higher valuation. 

**Should I consider all cash purchases?**

* Absolutely, I don’t think it’s ever been a better time.
* If you have an operations component and/or manage directly, you can get cash flow that will protect you from market mayhem, and if the debt market eventually comes down like it did 2016-2022, you have an incredible opportunity to refinance then. 
* It’s downside protection with mid-term upside.

**What strategies are doing best right now?**

* Conservative - Small / All Cash Deals - Whereas before it was impossible to get an owner to sell these, we’re finally seeing an opportunity to buy these assets in mass. As stated in the above section, these can have exceptional downside protection, high cash flow if you operate directly, and if debt ever comes down, a great upside potential. For people that looking for long-term, stable growth, this makes a lot of sense.   ***It's the best time period I've seen in my career for this strategy***.
* Moderate - Assets that need drywall, electrical, plumbing, or anything requiring a permit - The cost of this type of work is astronomical right now. I’ve seen $35k+ bids per unit with poor work that takes 9 months to complete. If you can do the work yourself or can partner with someone that can, the cost can be as low as $5k a unit and done in 1/8th the time. There are a tremendous amount of owners out there still waiting on contractors, so you can take these assets off their hands, finish the work, and then hold for cash flow, refinance, or sell. Even with the higher debt and lowered valuation, there is still a massive spread here. 50%+ levered returns in a year are not unrealistic. 
* Aggressive - Niche Single Family Home Development Plays - Despite everything you’ll see in the headlines, there are still great profits in certain types of home development plays. For context, most new home builds are suburban style homes that are built in mass on a 1.2-1.4X margin. So, if home prices come down 20-40%+ these developers could be wiped out. On in-town luxury product, however, where buildable lots are extremely rare, there is still a massive pool of demand for extremely limited product. The spreads on these types of projects are 2.0X-3.0X. This gives you an absolutely massive margin of safety. There is a lot of volatility here and it’s not the best for everyone, but I think it makes sense for a small portion of a portfolio looking for more aggressive plays.

**What cities should I invest in?**

* Firstly, you should always start where you have the best operational advantage. After that, consider the following:
* The rapid rise in housing costs in major metros has begun pushing people out. Starting about 6 months ago there has been a major reversal in rent growth from large towards small markets.
* Previously booming markets such as Austin, Phoenix, and Vegas that witnessed incredible appreciation are now showing decreases in rental rates while smaller markets are getting more demand.
* It makes far more economic sense for a waiter, educator, city worker, medical provider, or most of the 90% of the working population making less than $100k to move to a lower cost metro. So for every one new tech job, there are many more people who don’t want the associated cost of living that come with the new employer. 
* This all results in larger rent growth in smaller, more affordable markets, which is exactly what we are seeing. 
* Conclusion: From a pure growth standpoint, I believe you have the best rent growth relative to entry price in smaller, more affordable markets.  
* Where to get rental data: This is a great [source for raw data pulls on 200+ metros.](https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/category/data-rent-estimates)

**Should I 3rd Party PM, Direct Management, or Syndication?**

* What do you want your real estate to do?
* Conservative - If you want stable cash flow with some upside potential, operate it yourself or invest in a syndication that does. 
* Aggressive - If you want quick turns and believe certain markets are poised for large rent growth, then use 3rd party property management. You may not get any cash flow, and are in a riskier position, but if the valuations go up, you get the most return for the least amount of work. As much as I hate to admit it, this is who did best over the last 2 years. 

**What can I do to improve the likelihood of solid returns?**

* Align with your broker - by getting them into the deal, you can usually get a better price.
* Focus on the middle-market of renters – this is the majority of demand and the most insulated from market changes. 
* Implement a Tenant Respect Model - All too often in B/C class assets, especially in smaller markets, the tenants are not very well respected. A little can go a long way.  Consider preventive inspections, holiday gift cards, accommodations for unique needs, staff training on communication, etc..
* Consolidate assets – Buy a 30-50 unit then buy a nearby smaller assets.  Run everything together for a much lower op cost. 
* Keep the units under market - don't chase the highest return, chase stable occupancy.
* Keep substantial extra cash on hand to weather any kind of storm. This will lower total returns but also smooth them out and prevent the likelihood of needing an expensive injection

**What returns are realistic, what should I target?**

* It depends on the strategy, but assuming you are buying a multifamily asset, you could conservatively achieve a 5% cash on cash return in year 1, and 7%+ by year 2. 
* Over the course of 5 years, this should model out to about a 10-15% IRR with some work and an exit, unless the debt market drops in which case it would end probably 20%+  
* The returns in good syndications are often the same or better than if you manage directly, with a lot less work, but you can’t force an early sale, so there is a trade-off. 
* Anything below these returns and I honestly think you are better off investing in bonds, or if you have a long time horizon, the S&amp;P 500. 

**Should I have others invest with me?**  **Should I invest with others?**

* Over time, it's probably best to do both. It doesn't really matter the size, but it's more about the experience.
* If you take on investors, you should have a clearly articulated strategy for not just the current aspect but the next few. 95% of my investors either came through someone who has already invested with me, or they started with a small amount and we built the relationship over-time. So if you have just 1 asset you're looking to take down, that's not that compelling to an investor; but if you want to buy 3-4 multifamily assets in an area over the next few years and manage yourself, well, that's something you can build on.
* If you invest with others, a few quick things to look for: minimum 8% preferred return, no catch-up provision, 7%+ in Y1, and an understanding of how the group can own/manage the asset more efficiently than the previous owner.

**I’m in college and I love real estate, I want this as a career, so what should I do next?**

* There is no better way to learn the business of Real Estate than being a real estate or business owner, and I recommend starting as early as you can. 
* Counterintuitively, if you want to build a career in RE, don’t start there. Right now as it takes a tremendous amount of capital to create meaningful profits. So instead, consider buying a  coffee shop, laundromat, car wash, etc… This will require much less money than a big real estate asset and you can cultivate a much larger impact.  Most importantly, it’s going to force you to learn marketing, legal, investor relations, people management, etc… all at the same time.  I believe this will prepare you far better than any job at a real estate firm."

My brother lives in the town and would be able to visit the property for emergencies. 

It would be me and one business partner (he’d supply the majority of the cash, and I’d handle all management). We think the place would clear $100k gross year one, $180k year two, and also think the property will be worth $1M+ within 5 years.

\-No inspection (would have been at least $200k to get the house ready for market in a normal sale)

\-He covers and fees/taxes associated with the sale (besides capital gains obviously) 

\-And a 3 month lease back period where we would live at the house for free until we found a new place to live.

5728,realestateinvesting,Tenant paying for laundry utilities," 

Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this kind of advice, but I thought I'd give it a shot:

I’m in a bit of a pickle with the laundry room at my triplex and could use some guidance.

I bought the property in 2013 and moved into the front house. As a convenience for everyone, I discontinued the coin-op laundry contract and bought a new washer and dryer for everyone to use. I moved out years ago, so this is now purely an investment property.

The units are all detached, however the laundry room is attached to back unit. The laundry room has always been on the same gas/electric meter as the back unit, so the tenant has always paid the gas/electric expense. I pay for water for the property. This tenant is great - low maintenance, never complains, and takes great care of the unit.

Over the last several years, utility rates have shot through the roof in San Diego. The other tenants are running (hogging) the machines constantly. The tenant has provided me with her utility bills. Electric usage has gone up significantly (\~55%) since she moved in several years ago.

The machines are breaking at least every 6 months; my appliance guy says this is mostly due to pet fur (there are now 5 dogs on the property). This seems like the time for me bring in a coin-op laundry company back into the fold (pun not intended?). It will eliminate my laundry repair expense and bring in a minor revenue stream to help pay for the water utilities.

The question is what to do about the tenant in the back unit? I imagine that because the tenants will have to pay for their laundry, they will be more responsible about their usage. However I feel having the tenant now pay for laundry on top of the fact she’s paying for the utilities would simply not be fair to her and will send her packing. Would you recommend a credit of some kind? If so, what would it look like?

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for your insights!"

5767,realestateinvesting,HOME PURCHASE: I think seller lied. My realtor says it doesn’t matter because I signed an “as is” agreement.,"Two weeks ago I put an offer on a house I was interested in. It was a house that required a good amount of work from what I could see in the listing and I was looking for a fixer upper because I wanted to use the 203k loan. I went to see the house and for the most part it was cosmetic repairs (sand and polish hardwood floors, new trim, new doors, couple windows, and LVP to cover up the shitty tile in the bathrooms.) I submitted my offer - I offered 10k less than asking and they countered with some less on the asking price and 2.5% of sellers credit. I accepted the offer.  Right away I get a home inspector to check it out. He had a good report just points out safety concerns and things that are in either fair condition or in need of replacement/repair. Nothing crazy. I thought “okay, looking good so far.” I go over the roof part of the inspection report. He says there’s little bit of standing water on the roof (this is a flat rubber roof btw).He said the roof is not draining water properly and causing water to seep because the house also didn’t have gutters on the back side of the house. He requested I get a roofer to get an estimate for repair and new gutter to help with drainage. I wasn’t worried since the purchase agreement stated the roof was only 5 years old. I got three contractors to check it out. All three said I needed a complete tear out because the roof was actually flat and the pitch was non existent. Which explained the standing water of course. Even the roof on the garage was fucked. It was worse actually. So bad that a couple of the joists were split in the middle - prob from the weight of ice from past winters. What I want to know is if I am entitled to my earnest money? The seller up to this point cannot even produce receipts of the roof from five years ago because “ The original seller died and he was the one who actually had the roof replaced five years ago”. I think they are trying to stiff me. I don’t believe it for a second. The purchase agreement says 5 years old and as far as anybody knows a roof will last up to 20 yrs.

Anyway, I’m a first time home buyer too. So I’m curious to know isn’t it better to put it as PMI and be separate from my interest rate?  When I get to 20%, the PMI will go away right so isn’t that beneficial than having it longer term in my interest rate??

Obviously I could also wait another year and save $200k and have 20% down on a 1M but I'm wondering if I could skip that wait.

investors (not the no money down or make 30k in one day). I just had a couple of questions one being where to get hard money lenders ? I've seen a lot of people say going to real estate meetups or FB groups, or would financing a house be easier and refurbishing it and selling ?2nd is there a specific budgeting rule anyone uses ? Ex: purchasing the house for 70% of the after repair value. If there is any other information that would be helpful in getting started it would be helpful. A little about me i have roughly 15k of money i have saved i could use

5775,realestateinvesting,Being a private mortgage lender,"I have a property that I am likely going to to rent out,  but may have the opportunity to sell it and be a private mortgage lender to an acquaintance.  I haven't been able to find much personal experience as a private mortgage lender.   Anyone have experiences to share besides that of properly vetting the buyer?  Is it true they typically get higher than normal interest rates; upward of 10% even?  Any other big flags I am not considering? 

Pros:

1. Front loaded interest has some appeal to finance other venture(s)
2. far more ""hands-off"" - Particularly should I decide to leave the state. 

Cons:

1. appreciation of the house if I kept long term and rent 
2. Rents only go up 

Unknown

1. The foreclosure process should it come to that. (Already experienced in evictions in my area)

&amp;#x200B;

Background:  I am a former rental property owner, and I sold my multi-family house to finance a separation from my daughter's mother and reboot life. I am familiar with the ins/outs of being a landlord and using management companies.   The house in question is a fantastic 1st home, and one of our young engineers was telling us how he wants to buy a house, but can't because he had no credit. Not bad credit, just no established credit. blah blah blah. 

 I was advised it could sell for $175k  At just 5% interest on a $150k loan the interest would be $7k the first year.   Ideally, I wouldn't mind picking up a couple townhouses as rentals as well and the front loaded interest appeals to help get this off the ground. 

When I do the math it seems more profitable looking (shorter term) 5-years out than using it as a rental."

I could, theoretically draw up a business plan, and develop a business in which I use the land to generate income. Enough income to pay for the property itself as well as a decent amount of profit. 
I have this half assed worked out in my head, but I don’t know where to start. This is a CA property.

I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but if your loan is well below the rate of inflation, are you theoretically making money by paying it off on cheaper real dollars vs if you bought it outright?

This is the biggest reason I don't see a major correction happening. Even with rising unemployment, there will be little motivation to sell your investment property if you locked in a rate in the 2s or 3s. Conversely, if inflation does go down, so will rates, and the values will rise again anyway. Am I missing something?"

5792,realestateinvesting,starting to get into tax auctions,"Hello everyone. I'm currently trying to get my feet wet into real estate by use of tax auctions (in NY). I've gone to the county building for a search request to look up judgments that aren't already listed on the counties property site (they list county/village/school). The clerk told me to really only worry about anything that has the headings of ""state"", ""IRS"", or ""federal"". She said not to worry about it if they had a corresponding line elsewhere that stated it was settled, also, that person cases (name v. name) wouldn't be an issue.

So a few questions if I may:

1) I saw one with a bond lien that didn't have a settlement. Would that follow the property, or just the individual?
2) is there a reputable site to use to look up personal judgements and/or property liens? Obviously I would pay for this, but most I've seen look like scams. It was a stroke of luck I could even make it the first time, I doubt I could again. And I'm nervous; I don't want to make a mistake."

My plan is to start off in remodels, I want to do this first because this is a short term investment to get me my cash flow and down payment that I will need to start investing in properties, once I do this and remodel, I’m thinking about 2 to 3 homes and flipping for sale, I will have a big enough cash flow to start off, in either multifamily/single family homes and have tenants live there, once I do this, and begin to have profits on my investments that will become long-term, I want to build or buy apartment complexes. Obviously, this will take some time and I also plan on having two or three of these going on at the same time, for example, once I have remodeled two or three homes, and sold them, I plan on doing one or two more while having one or two properties for long-term investments, such as the multi family and single-family homes. And same thing with the apartment complex.

Does this seem like the correct order to start in, or should I do something else first? 
A little background information on me, I am 20m, I live in an apartment for about seven more months, i’m not too sure what I should do before the lease ends, I guess, determining which real estate investment I go for will determine whether or not i sign another lease, or use the rent money I pay now for a mortgage.

Howdy,

Background story before I get to the point of this post: I inherited this lot from my father after he passed away. I currently live with my mother (I pay our mortgage, so she can save up some money to buy herself another house in the near future. I plan on buying another house as well once the one we currently live in generates some cash flow).

I have a vacant corner lot that is currently valued at $43K (2022) on our CAD. The property has not utilities, however it is in a residential area with other houses around it. The land was paid in full back in 2005 for $15K. (.30 acres)

Within the last 5-10 years new houses have been built in the surrounding area. We have been thinking about getting rid of it because we aren’t too fond on the area. Plus multiple people have inquired about purchasing the property (it is not listed).

Initially, we wanted to build a house and rent them out and potentially sell down the road. However, with the cost of material and labor nowadays we have been leaning towards just selling the lot as is. Plus capital gains tax is going to take a lot of the profit.

In addition, we have no experience when building a house and I’ve heard it is expensive starting out —especially with utilities, permits, and other cost. 

We currently have a mortgage loan with an outstanding balance of $60K. Our goal is to rent this house out. 

After the information given, my two questions are: would you?

(A)Keep the lot, save up cash and build two houses - one at a time (1200 sq ft, this is the common size of houses in the area).

(B)Sell the lot and if so, how would you go about negotiating the price if they ask what our price range is? I know CADs can be well below the actual price.

5831,realestateinvesting,Question about SALT Cap and rental property income without an LLC,"In my state and at my level having an LLC doesn't actually provide any of the usual benefits, and in fact it can be counter-productive. But without one I can't use the normal SALT Cap workarounds (like paying state taxes at the entity level).

I know property tax on a rental property doesn't count towards the SALT cap even if you file without an entity, because you can deduct it against rental income on Schedule E instead of including it with your other state taxes on Schedule A. Your total taxable income is still reduced but it doesn't increase your Schedule A itemized deduction.

That got me thinking: can we deduct state income taxes paid on rental income the same way?

Let's say I pay $9k in property tax for my rental and  $5k in state income tax on the rent I collect. Can I include both of those state taxes on my federal Schedule E and reduce my taxable income by $14k? After all I don't actually get that money and if I had a formal business this would be a business expense. 

Of course, my investment property *isn't* a business as far as the IRS is concerned because I'm not a ""real estate professional,"" so that isn't the test.

If I had an LLC I could deduct it in excess of the SALT Cap anyway, because my state has a workaround to separate LLC taxes from your personal ones for this very reason - Eve  if it's a single-member passthrough LLC. 

However, since my investing is not a business concern and I'm filing it all on my personal taxes, I think I'm stuck with Section 212(2) which I think says I'm out of luck.

If I'm correct, Schedule E deductions are basically limited to ordinary and necessary expenses ""for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income."" 

I paid state income tax *on* the rental income, but not really as part of managing the property for the production of it like with property taxes.

Thoughts? Does this all seem right?"

5834,realestateinvesting,HELP! Tenants can't find a place to move to (we are moving back home)!,"Hello all, 

In a bit of a bind right now. We rented out our old home and recently sold our home to where we relocated to to move back to our hometown. We rented the home out to a very nice family with two dogs and a cat. They have kept the place in excellent shape and always paid early. Since they had such good references, we rented to them below market to keep them there and have no turnover. 

We are now moving back home and gave them 90 days notice. They are driving us nuts. They cannot find a place in their price range with what they need. The rent in our area has skyrocketed in the past year. They are paying about $1,000 less than what they should be at current market rates. 

We have been trying to help find places and they're being extremely picky. No complex will take them because one of their dogs is a banned breed (chow chow, which are very aggressive). I found them a new home, with a fenced yard, animals permitted. Their reply was ""we don't like it there"". Their standards are getting way too high and we are running out of time. What can we do? We are approaching the point of giving them 30 days (within legal standards) because their standards are way too high for their modest budget. Wine taste with a beer budget type of situation.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks."
5835,realestateinvesting,Square Footages Appraisal 500ft off? (25%),"I am currently buying our primary residence, and we’re about to close on a property. The listing agent had written 2,770 square feet everywhere (on pamphlets, the listing, etc.). Well, our appraisal came back today, and the house DID appraise, but the measured square footage was only 2,200 sq. ft. 

So around a 570 sqft difference - almost 25%…. I even went to the property myself with my agent and measured each floor. Yup, 2,200 square feet.

The house is supposed to close next Monday. I feel like the listing was completely misleading, and even though the property appraised, I worry about relisting this later on, with the lower square footage. Do I have any recourse? Can I go back to the sellers to renegotiate?"

And we also think this may help you prevent having future issues with plumbing, we just have to have you authorization first.""

Backstory, I lived in the house for 2 years, did some work on it, moved out and PM is now managing it since it is long distance.   


First month of it being rented the front door lock had to be replaced because it ""fell off""...worked fine for me for 2 years.  


Few months later the PM contacted me and said the kitchen sink was backing up (most likely because tenants are trying to put food down the drain) and that a plumber said the drain was too small. It was a 1 1/2"" drain and they wanted to put a 3"" pipe. 1 1/2"" is fine for a sink, 3"" is used for toilets etc. right? Again, worked fine for me for two years the way it is.  


Then the text yesterday asking about installing a garbage disposal and that. Now, this may be common, but the PM company has someone doing the lawn, and has someone for repairs. All invoices for these other services are under a different company, but they all share the same address, so...they are all owned by the PM company, and that is fine, I'd do the same thing.   


My thing is...I feel like my PM is just finding things to ""fix"" in order to put extra money in their pocket. I imagine my front door lock did not just ""fall off"". I also don't think the kitchen sink needed to be replumbed, and I know damn well I don't want to put in a disposal to ""prevent future issues with plumbing"". More than likely a disposal will introduce more issues down the line.

5846,realestateinvesting,Low Mortgage on Apartment but desperately need a home now," 

Hello all!

My wife and I have a one-bedroom apartment which currently has a 2.75% mortgage rate. We welcomed a little baby earlier this year and, despite how bad the market is right now, desperately need to move to a home.

We, in theory, think we can likely rent out the apartment to cover the operating costs of it (mortgage, insurance, etc) and would like to hold on to it as an investment. We have saved up a small amount to cover a down-payment on our home.

With mortgage rates the way they are now (High 6's, Low 7's), I was wondering if anyone knows of any creative solutions to help bring down the rates on a new home? Someone had mentioned to me in the past that you can utilize your low mortgage rate on the apartment to help offset a mortgage on a new home but I didn't fully understand it.

Any thoughts or input would be greatly appreciated! I really know nothing about mortgages or if there are any different ways to possibly hold on to the apartment we have and not get totally killed on a new home."
5847,realestateinvesting,Should I keep my house or sell it?,"I have a house which I got several years ago and rent to two sets of tenants.

Furthermore they ignored my very generous 'cash for keys' offer which was over 4 months worth of rent.

I was planning on keeping the house long term and for the rental income to be part of what supports me during retirement. But now I am facing $10k in repairs and another $3-6k for the eviction, wiping out nearly two years of rental profit. I managed to find an investor who made a fairly decent offer to buy the house even with the problem tenants. The offer is about 15% below market value, but I won't have to pay closing costs or agent commissions. 

What should I do in this situation?"

Some are ghetto like, some are not. I wonder if it is possible to do one's due diligence, get the green light from an inspection report, close, rehab, rent and fail. 

Pessimistically, or perhaps realistically, I suppose there are several ways to fail. For one, something may not have been found from the inspection. It is a non-destructive/invasive inspection after all. Rehab could go tremendously over-budget. Holding costs could be slightly higher. Rent could be significantly lower than researched. It may also be years before it is opportune to refinance. 

Optimistically, if one has done thorough research, I think how it's hard to fail. Has anyone failed with a BRRR due to something more or less out of your control?"

5876,realestateinvesting,How I flipped a lot and made $40K,"Sharing in case anyone might find it useful.  Earlier this year, we sent out about 100 direct mail letters to owners of vacant lots in a particular area.  We focused specifically on lots that were zoned R2, meaning you could build a duplex on the lot.

Received a call from one of my letters and bought the lot from the guy for $35K using a private lender.  It was an oversized lot (formerly 3 lots, but redrawn into one single lot).  After purchasing, we applied to resubdivide the lot into 2, and got approval.  We spend roughly $5,000 on grass cuts, survey, resub fees and interest to investor.  We sold one of the lots to another investor for $35K and planned to build a duplex on the other lot (now owned it free and clear with $5K out of pocket).  While waiting to build (we had a few other projects in line before this one), an investor reached out asking if I had any lots of be willing to sell.  I threw out $45K and he agreed.  Fast forward 3 weeks and we just closed today.  Net proceeds were $44,500.  Not a bad deal!

Tldr: bought a lot for $35K plus $5K in fees/ expenses. Had the lot divided into 2.   Sold one for $35K and the other for $45K.  Walked away with ~$40K profit with very little money out of pocket."

5896,realestateinvesting,Which route to take to purchase next LTR?,"Hi all,

My wife and I are currently living with her parents while we rent out our primary residence-turned-LTR. We bought it for $150k in a smaller college town in upstate NY and the rental market is excellent here -- many properties sell for cheap and the rents are much higher here -- almost 1.2-1.5% of purchase price for most LTR. 

We're currently pulling in ~$1000/month after paying mortgage, insurance, fees, etc. and we're eager to purchase another LTR to bring in more money. 

Together we have about $20-$25k liquid with another $20k in a roth IRA that we could utilize for downpayment on our next property.

We have the option of purchasing another primary and living there for a year before renting it out again to take advantage of the lower down payment, but this option feels 'longer' to cashflow. If we did this, we could afford a nicer home (similar to price in what we purchased for our current LTR ) in a better area, which means better tenants and hopefully less headache. 

The other option is to purchase a cheaper home -- there are many available in the $70-$100k price range but they're in worse areas, usually need a bit more work, and tenants might not be as great. The advantage is that we have enough money to use an investment loan and begin rehabbing and renting it out immediately. 

I'm worried about the headache of option 2 but also don't want to wait too long to begin cashflowing for option 1. What's everyone's thoughts?"

(the land is owned) Assuming I build a $270,000  (1800sqft duplex) I could get $1250 per side. The numbers aren't adding up for me, here's the monthly breakdown: 

P/I: $1510 assume @7.5% interest/20% down

10% maint: $250

1mo. vacant/per : $208

insurance: $166 ?

taxes: $157

lawn care: $60 ?

TOTAL = $2343

This results in a whopping $157 cash flow, a 3.3% CoC return and a CAP rate of 7.41% which doesn't even beat my assumed interest of 7.5%. What do you guys think? It doesn't look promising. (I can't live in one side, I own my primary outright and have a wife &amp; kid that I'm not moving, however I am open to other development options since I own the land. (4 acres) )"
5899,realestateinvesting,To people that own 10+ rental properties in EE (Eastern Europe) how do you do that?.,"I've met a lot of people that own anywhere from 4-12 properties and all of them say just loan money and invest... yes but how do you do that ?.  The bank won't give you 10 loans and considering the current prices in EE 10 properties in big cities worth anywhere from 80,000-120,000euro each. Lets say he got 800,000-1,000,000euro in portfolio since EE is quite poor for USA or other rich European countries.

My question is if there are people that do that what is the trick... I doubt its from 0 to something.

Many people in EE say these people that own multiple properties are scammers or politicians since our salaries can't match up with even getting a mortgage."

5905,realestateinvesting,need some advice! inherited properties,"Sooo this is a lot but I’ll try to make it short. Basically I’m a PT working (15/hr, but part goes to 401k and stocks so rlly like 13/hr, &amp; ~20hr a week) FT college student, I just inherited 2 small houses from my mom 2 years ago when she passed away. They’ve been rented out, but I’ve been fixing one up and it’s vacant. The one I’m fixing up is paid off and worth about 150k, the other about 190k with a ~50k mortgage left. It’s in rougher condition as well and being rented out for 1300 so I’m not profiting much with an 800/mo mortgage payment + taxes, etc. 
My dad and step mom are pushing me out of their house and I am trying to make the best decision about how to afford an apartment or condo. I don’t want to live in the house I am fixing up because it has a history of family turmoil/trauma and it’s not in the best area, I wouldn’t feel comfortable living there as a young female. My ideal would be to pay off a condo in full and not have a mortgage payment, however the fees, taxes, etc would still put me at about 600-700/mo which I would have to dig into the savings I make from selling the houses until I graduate and get a better job in 2 years. 
Another option I have is to pay off the mortgage of the second house and charge the renters a few extra hundred bucks a month which they already agreed they would and rent an apartment/put a downpayment on a condo until I graduate. I’m not a fan of renting but between these two options I am leaning towards apartment because it will be cheaper per month. Around 1500 vs a condo which is around 2000. I will only be pulling in ab 1100 a month with my current job (which is all gone after my current expenses) but I will have the rent income (potentially 1600) and savings (at least 100k). I could also get a roommate, the only person I’m interested in having as one though won’t be able until next fall so I’ll have to live on my own for about a year. But I can keep looking for someone. 

Any and all advice is welcome, I’m trying to get different points of view as this is a big decision for me."

5930,realestateinvesting,Buying parents a house. Is this crazy?,"My parents have rented their entire lives. As they are getting older, they still struggle to make ends meet and will likely work well-beyond retirement age.

I am fortunate to be in a secure, high-paying career. I want to put them in a house to eliminate their monthly rent expense, accelerate their savings, and finally help them get ahead in life.

**My plan:**

* I would get a traditional 30-year mortgage, and cover the upfront costs (20% down, closing, etc.)
* I would contribute a fixed amount to the monthly mortgage payment, so that the remainder is in-line with their current rent expenses
* Part of my annual compensation is a significant performance-based bonus. I would direct most of that into an aggressive lump-sum payment to reduce the mortgage as quickly as possible. 

Saving that payment for the end of the year gives me a safety net in case we have a bad year, or run into the risks outlined below. By my quick estimates, we could have the home paid off in 3-5 years. If something goes wrong, we could just extend the payment timeline.

**I have two questions:**  


* I know we're entering a period of uncertainty in the market. There are a couple benefits I could see for delaying the start of this plan - lower home prices, better interest rates. But if my goal is to pay the mortgage off as quickly as possible to eliminate that monthly expense for my parents, how much advantage is really to be gained from waiting (beyond just access to more properties in my budget)?  

* I've considered various risks / opportunity costs associated with this plan. 
   * **Risk:** I or my parents would lose/change jobs in the next 3-5 years. 
      * **Answer:** This is nominal, but a risk that I accept. In the worst-case scenario, we are back to our current position.
   * **Risk:** The market crashes, the value of the home could sharply decrease.
      * **Answer:** I plan to keep the house and ultimately rent it out, so this is not as much of a concern.
   * **Risk:** The opportunity cost of putting that lump-sum payment into equities / down payments on additional investment properties. 
      * **Answer:** Helping my parents now matters more to me than the potential compound interest gains down the road.
   * Are there other major risks / opportunity costs I'm not considering?

I understand that this isn't the most profitable investment strategy. It's being driven by emotion/love - (""what's the point of having money if I can't use it do what matters most to me?""). My hope is that you can help me view this objectively. 

If it's helpful, we live in the Southern California area. Thank you for your insight!"
5931,realestateinvesting,Under time pressure to receive a sudden gift - anything we haven't thought about?,"I've read a lot of posts about inheritances and gifts. Some are similar but different enough (a multifamily, a commercial property, shares in an S- Corp, has tenants, multiple recipients e.g. sharing with siblings...) Also the ""About"" tab has a massive amount of resources,I don't know where to start reading.

I figure I'll get a flood of solicitations and stuff in my inbox, but I never work with people I don't already know or are highly recommended by a trusted friend or family who has worked with them before. That is to say, those DM's are gonna get ignored.

First off:

* Do I have a real estate attorney in that market? Check. I had to deal with a different family member's real estate issues on their behalf and they already had an attorney who seems competent and was trusted by them. Said attorney is out of town for a few more days but I'm trying to get some foundation of knowledge before I talk with them (and start generating fees)
* Have I consulted with tax professionals? Yes
* Have I checked with friends etc. in my network who may be able to help? Yes. Nobody has anything to offer.
* Do I live in the same market? Nope. X-country

My Situation:

* Married with kids
* Don't own a home, saving up to purchase, wife wants to
* Good income, puts me in the 1%. Not at all finance or investing related in our work
* Planned to get into REI someday, have parents who do it and we'd have to take over someday hopefully not soon though
* Have a joint Delware LLC we're not using, intended to use it to invest in something else but that never happened.
* Not at all familiar with NYC, visited 2x for a few times each only for job interviews.
* Have cash accounts and wealth manager/ financial advisors at one of the big banks

The Property

* 2 bed/bath
* About 2K square feet
* Purchased for about $4M
* Property taxes looks like just under 50K/yr
* HOA about 5K? have to confirm, a month. Includes maintenance requests, doorman, etc.
* Inside the ""Highline"" whatever that is in the south part of Manhattan (yes I'm that ignorant of NYC)
* If rented the company that manages the building would handle any repair requests as part of the HOA fee

The Gift

* One of our parents purchased a property in Manhattan that was under construction about 5 ish years ago
* Planned to live part time in the US there, maybe retire there full time as things are getting less favorable back home
* Pandemic and other factors prevented it from happening except as a place to stay for occasional short visits
* Decided to change plans, had intended for us to inherit someday, but wants to simplify their life and get rid of it.
* Now wants to give it to us outright. ""Take it quick before I change my mind!""

The Questions

* Sounds like it's a bad time to sell, we'd get no step up in basis and it's not a great market?
* Sounds like getting a fully paid for luxury condo in NYC is about as good as it gets with an existing management company, why would we want to consider selling anyway? (Change my mind?)
* Renting could target wealthy/high income/HNW tenants or is that tougher than we would think?
* If you had kids etc. would you recommend putting it into a trust or our LLC and make them co owners of the LLC? We might inherit additional real estate or assets in the future. Parents have talked about liquidating, and are opaque about their property/assets.
* Would you consider taking out a mortgage to help pay for our own home, or is that not a good idea and keep saving? We're close to target for down payment but are also in a high COLA region.
* How do you find an appraiser? In the past our realtor or title company or whoever took care of that and we just ran with it. Maybe just ask our attorney?
* Anything else we should think about?

We're in no rush once the transfer is completed, and plan to take our time and get educated before making additional moves. We just were informed two nights ago by this parent and were told we need to get things moving on our end to complete the transfer before EOY.

We have a 4 plex, two SFH and a condo.  All are occupied with very LT tenants, that are locked in at ridiculously low rent. &lt;$1000 for nice units.  The condo and 1 SFR is fully paid off w no mortgages.

We live in California and are now considering taking all of our equity out of Canadian properties to invest in US as prices fall.

Our concern with LTR in Canada is that we have to issue tenants tax documents detailing their annual rental payments which they then claim on their income taxes.  This leads to paying income taxes on all rents we receive.

Questions:

1. In the US, is it common that not all rents received are claimed on taxes since there really is no tax documents issued to tenants similar to Canada?

2.  Should we just leverage our canadian properties to the max and use that equity for US investments closer to hime?

3.  Or should we entirely liquidate Canadian properties to invest the equity in US given that our tenants are likely to stay in place for decades with very low rents.

I am leaning towrds option in #2 as I don't want to get stuck with Canadian capital gain type tax.  If we do sell, I think we would need to leverage cashout refis first to limit tax obligations on the equity from the sell, correct.

We have about $1M in equity that we want to work with, any help with strategy appreciated!"

I want to invest in the area I live in, which means buying a home in the 400-600k range that clearly will not meet the standard 1% rule guidance.

There are also a lot of new builds in areas that are developing rapidly that I KNOW will be desirable and rentable to a great pool of tenants. But for some reason new builds seem taboo here. If I can buy a new build in a great area for 500k, should I do that if the math works with a big enough down payment? I know it’s not optimal to scale a massive portfolio this way but if my goal is to have a small portfolio of SFH and townhomes in this area (3-5) and have them paid off to live off of the income - it seems that this is okay.

The buyer would need either cash, a loan from bank for the 150k or get seller financing to buy out the seller?  Or something else?

My family lives there and we thought it'd be a good place to start a home ownership and rent the unit out until we're ready for a house of our own. We bought in July 2021 and the interest rate has been creeping up and now we're having to pay $500-$600 out of our own pocket on top of our rent to cover the mortgage. 

Thank God our rent is very low so for now we can afford it but I am so worried. The market in that area was booming but nowadays they are not selling and 3 units in our apartment has been on market for 105+ days and I'm worried that in 2-3 years (when we plan to sell) that it won't sell or we'd have to sell for less.

The realtor assured us that next year the market will pick up again and that the mortgage rates will decrease a bit but I'm very pessimistic at this point and imagining me going bankrupt because of the recession and the interest rate went up to 10% and hate myself for rushing into buying a home...

Will it be worth it in the end like my realtor and parents are telling me? How are you dealing with the increasing rates and how are you preparing for it?

If you break the mortgage before the end of term (and interest rates are lower) you have to pay the difference in rate for the remainder of the term.  I know of people that got hit with $30k penalties when they sold/refinanced.  

Does the same apply for 30yr mortgages?"

5965,realestateinvesting,cash flow before maintenance too low for potential rental property?,"I bought a 1000 sqft single family home for $200,000 with $50k down a few years back. Payments are just under 1200/mo, and rent for similar homes are 2000+/mo. After piti and income taxes, I'd probably be left with around 7000 annually if I rented the place out at 2k. There's 150k in equity on the property if my lenders estimate is correct, and similar homes have been selling for higher than their current estimate.

This would be my first investment property, and I don't really know what to expect in regards to maintenance costs. The major items I think about needing repairs/replacement include central ac, furnace, water heater, and the roof. None are under any warranty, but are in good condition for now. I was thinking about borrowing against the equity to pay for large repairs, and use cash flow for small repairs/repayment of equity loan/loc. 

I could sell the house but feel like holding on to it might be worth it over the next few decades. Am I cutting it too close and run the risk of going negative cash flow? Thanks!"

5970,realestateinvesting,Seller wants $1M(worth $940k per my analysis) but ok to do partial seller financing. Any ways to creatively structure the deal?,"Hey All - I ran my numbers on an 8 unit multi-family and the max I should offer accordingly to my analysis is $940k.

The seller is stern on $1M but is ok to do seller financing for upto $300k.

I am in a problem-solving mode right now so wanted to post here to see if anyone can propose any compelling options.

Really appreciate any creative insights here to make the owner feel like he’s winning here and get a deal done."
5971,realestateinvesting,How to propose seller financing? What do you believe works for proposing terms?,"After asking sellers what they want (harder done than said), how do you start the proposition?

Maybe most sellers just want $20k or $50k down no matter the equity or value of the sale. Maybe sellers do not distinguish between a 15 and 18 year term. What works:

1. 5-20% money down
2. 3% interest rate?
3. 5-30 year term
4. 1-30 year balloon (and multiple balloons)

So far I have just been looking at MLS listings. Two/two listing agents flat out said the owners were not open to seller financing. So I have not gotten to actually proposing seller financing (SF) yet."

5973,realestateinvesting,"Large property owners - equity rich, cash flow poor?","I am curious how many others have the same position as me. I own a pretty good sized portfolio. However, due to my growth plan, my cash flow isn't what most would envision. I have maybe $10M in equity but most of my P&amp;L goes to principal paydown. I am trying to determine if I should slow down my growth and just let things ride for a bit so my interest decreases with principal paydown, while natural rent growth occurs to get in a better cash flow position, or continue to go for heavy growth knowing cash flow will remain low but it'll be a larger payoff one day when I divest some."
5974,realestateinvesting,How important is curb appeal?,"My hubby and I have been getting ready to invest in real estate. We're really new to this and since studying up on it, have been talking to our parents as well. Because of this, my parents now want to consider real estate investing for the first time. They bought a fixer upper manufactured home and some land. My sister and her hubby are contracted to do the labor of fixing it up so they are saving money there. But my parents are known to be super cheap. They bought exterior paint and it is a bright green. Like the kind you see around Halloween. I'm trying to convince them to repaint it but my mother only sees it as more money being spent. The trim is white and the shutters are black. It's not pretty. 

Is it worth the money and effort to repaint if it means they will get more/better offers if it's  a more appealing color? Or should we leave it as is and the new owners can paint it if they wish?"

5979,realestateinvesting,Steps to Scale HELOC.,"So i have a question. I have a $200k HELOC right now. How should I use it to scale? From 1 door - 10 doors. Do I buy the property with the HELOC(Cash) Refi the house at 75% LTV. then buy again even though I have some HELOC not fully paid.

Example

1) Buy 80k home plus 20k reno = $100k

2) Refi $100k at 75% LTV

3) Pay off $75k of the $100k HELOC = $25k balance on the heloc. 

Should I pay this off first then go HAM on another one? Or Just keep going until I have no HELOC money left then use the CashFlow and put it all on the $200k HELOC. I have a 10 year draw period at Interest rate of PRIME minus 0.49%. Hopfully everyone understood my problem. Have a great weekend."
5980,realestateinvesting,I would like to know about your experiences on rental properties in rural area or high crime areas.,"I've been investing in rental properties in NW  and Cali, buying in desirable locations ( low crime, 9+ schools, suburb near downtown), I find that I'm not getting good returns.  Many people are investing in cities with higher crime rates, decreaing demographics like Detroit, rural areas town of 10k or 50k.--&gt; more affordable areas, and tend to see them more associated with BRRR strategies.  It feels like the folks that adopt those locations tend to also have very positive cash flow(at least my perception that they do well financially).  I would like to understand the folks that take on these rental properties in very small towns, or in SFH or MFH, with higher crime areas, how are you faring?  I mean 1/ financially returns are good?  Are these tenants more risky (ie crime/police issues/harassment, eviction, have to chase rent every month? Are taking on these properties more time consuming, thus not as passive?   Serious question, just want to understand if you guys have it figured out.  Thanks!"

5982,realestateinvesting,Property Management Terminated me and then walked it back?,"Been with my Property Management for 5 years now (23 doors) and about a year ago I motivated my Dad to retire and buy some property for cashflow (6 doors); he then got set up with my Property Manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, things between myself and Property Management are relatively smooth and I'd say I have a good relationship with them, but my Dad is admittedly a little arrogant and doesn't handle stress well and it wasn't long before he started making claims that he should be getting more rent, he was being overcharged on maintenance, etc... It didn't take long before his relationship soured with Management's staff and today we both received a Termination Email giving us until early December to find new management.

&amp;#x200B;

I called my PM, because I was pretty unaware at the time that my Dad had been accusing them of anything except privately to me on the phone. Even so, I'm not sure why I was also receiving this email and why he wouldn't call me if he had grievances to discuss. I've done a lot of work over the years with these people and spent lots of money renovating with them and felt like I was at least owed a discussion on the issues at play.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I was able to smooth things over a bit, and they'll continue managing my real estate while I have to find someone else to work with my Dad. I didn't really fight them on that decision and am scouting around for a replacement for my Dad; it's probably for the best. However, I can't help but feel a little betrayed. Everything could have been handled better considering my properties and my Dad's properties are being managed separately.

Should I be looking for new management for myself?"
5983,realestateinvesting,House hack/Renting a guest house,"I was running numbers on duplexes in the area I’m moving to and I just didn’t like it. Plus I want a garage. It’s waaaaaaay cheaper to get a 3 or 4 bed house that also just so happens to have a guest house. I contacted zoning where I’m moving to and they basically told me I would have to apply for a zoning exception and talk to all of the neighbors and the neighborhood organization to do short or medium term rental of the guest house. If there are objections, it’ll be much more difficult to get the excel. That was kind of a dream crusher since it seems risky to buy a property with the intent of using the extra structure but not being 100% sure I could. I also know there are tons of people who rent these things out and ignore zoning. 

I’ve been crunching numbers, looking at maps, thinking about alternatives…I’m gonna drive myself crazy haha. Has someone ran into this? Solved it? Any soothing words for what I thought was my key to my first home buy and house hack? I even had a way to separate part of the main house so I could do short term while not having them in the main part of the house. The best laid plans…"
5984,realestateinvesting,Do banks only lend on income and not assets?,"I wanna be clear on this, lately I’ve heard this from a few people now but I want to get more insight so I made this thread.

It doesn’t make sense to me that someone with like 3, 6 or 8 monthly cash-flowing rental properties plus their day job(s) can’t qualify for another loan; I mean I’ve even seen RE investors w/ a few single family homes who are on student or car loan debt still qualifying somehow. Income is income, and if the DTI meets the criteria then they should be good, right? 

But is there something I’m missing completely or is that just some lenders?"

Bought a 4plex back in Nov 2021 (living in one unit), and what no one mentioned when we looked at the place was the disruptive fire alarm several miles away.  It's not a big deal during the day, but it goes off at 1, 3, 4 am.  It's like a tornado warning siren, but I think they use it for every single call. I've tried contacting them about it, since other fire departments no longer use the siren.  The fire chief said the state is looking for viable alternatives, but so far nothing.  Anyone else run into an issue like this?  Who would be the next person up from the fire chief?  And is there a better sub to post this in... thanks for reading if you got this far."

So my parents bought a property back in 1985 and have been renting it since.  It is a duplex where they use to live on one side for a few years before moving to a single family home.  My dad passed away in 2016 and my mom and I are looking at selling it soon.  I have been doing her taxes since 2016 but didn't know anything about the depreciation credit.

5997,realestateinvesting,"Cash rich, unstable income in LA, what to do?"," 

I'll keep this short --

I'm a late 20's single woman in LA, I happen to have about $300K in liquid savings. My income is unpredictable but should be at least $48K in 2023.

I've actually been approved for a loan of up to $700K at 6% interest.

I am interested in buying property, but La is so expensive and this sub kind of scared me away from the condos I was looking at, as they were all in Van Nuys and surrounding areas that reddit deems seeedy.

Right now I rent a tiny, uncomfortable studio apt in hollywood area for $1200, the condos I was looking at were 2bdr, $480-$500K, and with 25% down, the monthly payments would be about $3200 which I don't mind dipping into my savings to cover, if need be..

Either way, I want to invest my money in something. I have done a lot of research and am also considering purchasing a investment property in a different state (AZ, NC). All I know is, I don't like my tiny shitty studio, and I want to build equity + not just have my money rotting and diminishing in regular savings. Please help ... what would you do?"
5998,realestateinvesting,"First time RE investor, should I wait?","Hi all,

I'm really interested in starting to invest in real estate to diversify my portfolio and grow my money. I've maxed out my 401k, opened a traditional IRA, 529 for the kids and have a decent amount in the market. I have saved about 150k, half of which is sitting in CDs and HYSA. My main objective in investing in real estate is to have additional cash flow and make better use of cash that is just sitting there. At the moment, I'm mostly interested in SFH near college towns and renting them out. Given the interest rates, I'm debating whether to buy a SFH in a price range of 150-200k or take this time to learn more, increase my savings and purchase a property anywhere from 6-12 months from now. 

Any advice for a newbie?"
5999,realestateinvesting,Creative Solution to Owner Financing,"I have had my eye on a specific building for years.  It's an old brick 4 story building, mixed use, with approximately 27k square feet of space.  It's located downtown in a growing small city in a desirable area.  The top two floors almost certainly have sweeping views of the surrounding area - which are lake/mountain views.  There is a commercial tenant on the bottom floor but only 4 small apartments in the rest of the building.  It is grossly under utilized.  There could be another 15-20 units (or more!) built if it were to be built out - many with beautiful views in a downtown location. 

The owner is getting what he needs from the building right now, so he doesn't care.  Basically, the tenants enjoy cheap rent but they know they're on their own if anything breaks.  I spoke with the owner recently who said that he would consider selling and owner financing, but he doesn't understand how that would benefit him - he's cash flowing and it's low maintenance.  

Now a little about me - I am an inexperienced developer, but I am a real estate attorney, so I am fairly confident that I could put together a good team.  I can't, however, come up with enough cash to both purchase the property with a bank loan (at least 25% down) and cover the cost of construction.  So owner financing is a must.  The current owner basically said he's looking for a few things to motivate him to sell:  a financial reason beyond just collecting a little interest and a continued interest in an apartment in the building.   He said ""penthouse"" apartment, but who knows what that really means.  While I love the idea of structuring something where he gets a free apartment - that could be worth half a million dollars or more.  That's a big ask.  

I would love to come up with a way to structure the deal so he sells to me and I'm given this opportunity.  The best that I can think of is something like this: 
1. an owner financing at prevailing rate with a balloon after 5 years and;
2. make the units into condos where he can have the apartment of his choice, and the fair market value of that apartment is deducted from the amount due on the note.  

I would love to hear if anyone in this community has done something similar or if there are creative solutions that I haven't thought of.  Any advice or ideas are welcome.  Thank you!"

6006,realestateinvesting,Question about Loan Amount vs Loan Proceeds for Excel Model,"Hey guys,

I'm working on building out an extensive excel model for BRRRR-type investments. I'm having a bit of trouble with Loan Amount vs Loan Proceeds for the hard money/bridge loan in relation to closing costs/points/fees for the loan. My question is, do most hard money lenders wrap closing costs into the loan and deduct it from the loan proceeds? Or does the lendee pay the fees out of pocket?

Ex) Total amount needed: $155,000;

LTV: 80%

Loan Amount: $124,000

Closing Costs/Points/Fees: $3,720

Is the Loan Proceeds now $120,280? Or is it the Loan Amount of $124,000? If it's deducted from loan proceeds, is that amount amortized across the life of the loan? (So basically making interest-only payments on $124,000, instead of $120,280?)

I know this is probably confusing and I'm not explaining it well, but if something needs more elaboration, please let me know and I'll go into more detail.

So I understand that some people don't like section 8 because of repairs/maintenance, but in this investment there are no maintenance costs borne by the investor during the guaranteed rental period  (1,5,10Y) and it is totally hands-off.

I'm a travel technician and I make an estimate of approximately 70-90k a year and I'm in my late 20s but I just started the job and planning on finishing school and have a few debts so I'm still with my parents. In addition to that I'm also working on turning some side hustles into bigger flows of income to combine with my digital investments. Yet the market is so bloated that I just can't wrap my mind around it. I can't even afford a studio apartment unless I leave to an entirely different state and that's not even considering all the unforseen financial factors. My current savings is more of an emergency fund than anything. I really want to be a homeowner but that reality is getting closer and closer to a being just a dream. I'm still remaining diligent but I just can't help the growth of my doubts increasing by the days. 

Then it dawned on my how easy it used to be not even in that long ago maybe even around 2012-16? And I know I missed out but I want to know what I could do to get better at recognizing opportunities to dive in, in the coming future.

6030,realestateinvesting,BRRRR Question,"Hello, all! I am looking to do a BRRRR on a house that needs a complete rehab. My main question is am I allowed to cash out refinance after the house is completed? I plan to purchase in cash from a HELOC. I’ve seen with mortgages you typically need to wait 6 months (if you have an existing loan), but wasn’t sure about whether or not it mattered if you used cash.

Thanks!

6031,realestateinvesting,Cash out refinance viable? How do I navigate?,"I was recently passed down a property that has a return on equity of around 10%. The property is paid off in full. The logical thing to do should be to refinance the property and use the money for other investments. 

The problem I'm having is finding another investment that cash flows me the same amount every month. 

For example: this property cash flows me $6k monthly. If I refinance and pull a loan of $800,000, the debt service will eat away my cash flow and I can't find another property that will combine with the current property to cash flow $5k monthly. 

Is it better not to refinance in my scenario?"

6038,realestateinvesting,What would you do with $300K: Fix &amp; flips or spec development?,"I am looking to sell my sole rental unit and stand to net around $300K.  I want to make the leap to the next level and I'm debating what to invest in: fixing and flipping multiple units or building a multi-unit property.

I live in a healthy market (Denver metro-area) and the average home price is around $350K.  Some points of clarifcation:

- The hottest areas (and the ones I'm most familiar with) are more likely to demand $450K
- I have the option of including a partner able to provide an additional $100K
- Existing relationship with a realtor could result in a 0.5% reduction in selling agent commission
- Very High to high risk acceptance and no timetable for return

I have contacts with a development company if I were to go down the development route, but have no experience there.  Additionally, I have very basic handyman experience, so a fix and flip would require a heavy reliance on contractors.  

I'd love some thoughts as to how others would look to utilize this capital to springboard further transactions. "

6042,realestateinvesting,Was it a good investment? 2 year look back.,"About 2 years ago I finally bought my first rental property, a single family home in Rockford IL - about 2 hours outside of Chicago. Bought it ""as-is"" for 42,000 cash. It needed some work done to it cosmetically that mainly my wife and I put in. We got the very worn out carpet removed and the hardwood floors redone. A curve ball came when my insurance company told me I HAD to replace the roof or they would drop me - the home inspector said it had maybe 5 years left. A year into it the water heater needed to be replaced.

So the first two years I had some rather serious out of pocket expenses. My wife and I keep good records and I was actually able to go back and count every dollar I put into the property

NOT including the actual cost of the physical property, I have over 2 years spent 18,000. This includes:

$6,000 to have the roof replaced (tear off)
$900 for water heater
$1300 to have the hard wood floors redone and stained
$550 to have bathroom exhaust fan installed
Various other expenses either before tenants moved in and then various repairs throughout the year (leaky faucet, door hinge broken,ceiling fan not working, etc).

Including these fixed, recurring costs:
$900 2014 property taxes (still had the owner occupied exemption since technically I lived there for a short period of time)
$1650 2015 property taxes
$1530 2 years of land lord insurance 

My rent is 850/month with a 10% to the PM so I get 765 a month. Over 2 years, essentially I collected 18,000 in rent which incidentally is basically the amount I have spent into the property.

I'm having a hard time counting this as a success. Wondering what the experts think of this. Did I just have a string of bad luck with these major repairs? I know that going forward, the roof wont have to be replaced for another 10-15 years, the hot-water tank for another 6-8, the AC for another 10 so I am starting to run out of major expenses to the place

I'd like to buy another rental property - this is my first and only one so far but look at it this way, keeping it in a diversified portfolio almost seems better (we have roughly the same amount in a diversified portfolio and it has done better than this property's cash flow). Maybe I am just thinking about this wrong?

Any insight, suggestions, slaps in the face or advice would be appreciated.

6043,realestateinvesting,FHA question: Final value after second appraisal (x-post from /r/realestate),"I am very close to closing on a flip I did in a poor area of my town where I'm pretty much limited to offers with FHA financing. The first appraisal came back very low. I negotiated with the buyers that they give up their closing cost assistance and I drop the contract price to the appraised value. All was well and we were two days from closing when the buyers' lender realized that FHA rules for a flip dictate that two appraisals must be ordered to determine the value.

I am confident the first appraiser erred in his valuation and that the second appraisal will come back higher. I have negotiated with the buyers that, if the second appraisal comes back higher, the contract price will be adjusted to the second appraisal value, however I am wondering if anyone here knows how the FHA guidelines handle this issue. Obviously, there will almost certainly be a difference between any two appraisals on the same property, not accounting for passage of time.

The contract price was originally ~$135k and the first appraisal came back at $120k. So, if the second appraisal comes back at $130k, how will the FHA handle that in terms of their underwriters determining the value?

Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated!

If a person bought a lot of small-acreage rights ahead of a drilling trend, then invested in the wells themselves when a company drills in that section, it would be a pretty solid investment, right?

3. How much does following Macro trends impact your investing? For example, potential for immigration reform and its probable reduction of the supply of renters increasing foreclosures and thus opportunity. Is thinking about these types of things too far out?

6055,realestateinvesting,Effect of commercial crash on residential values,"Hello all,

I would like to get your thoughts on what would happen to both the SFR and multi-family markets if there is a crash in commercial real estate. 

I think long term demand for commercial RE will be lower due to the combined affects of job automation and tele-presence.  People will just need less offices and physical stores.  This should translate into even more inventory on the Class A multi-family front, since some of the commercial spaces could be converted to large multi-family.  "
6056,realestateinvesting,How soon can you pull equity out?,"I am thinking of buying a house for cash to rehab while I live in it with the goal being to sell next spring. I would use the cash to fund the next rehab.

If I decided to hold and rent it instead, how much seasoning is needed to pull equity out of a house (approx 70-75% or the typical max allowed)? assume credit is poor/fair and minimal income to show outside of rental income. In other words, just based on rental income from the property itself, how many months would it need to be occupied with a tenant in order to be able to borrow against it and what is the approx amount that could be borrowed?

Example:
buy house for 30k and rehab. The new value is now 70k and rents for 700.00 a month. So 700$/month coming in from rent (gross). how many months occupied with tenant before being able to pull equity out?

6057,realestateinvesting,Advice on properties to buy in your area,"I'm a pretty hands-on, DIY landlord, and I have found myself living (at least for now) in an area that is seeing some nice housing value increases (with more to follow as a new stadium for the Braves finally goes into service). My first property was in this area, and prices have gone up, and it's nice having a property that I'm 2 minutes away from. 

With this in mind, has anyone had experience trying to buy properties as rental properties that aren't for sale? Obviously, I mean, for example, cold calling/mailings. Based on tax records, the area I am interested in has a good mix of families, some appear to likely not even be on mortgages anymore, and many people with the 65+ tax exemption. Does anyone have tips for approaching/looking for properties that sellers may be willing to part with if offered? Taxes are due next month, and I was also thinking about waiting to see if anyone fails to pay their taxes to see if I can come in with an offer, considering the owner would clearly not be able to handle the cost of ownership at that point.

6059,realestateinvesting,Fixer upper or new home?,"My wife and I are weighing two homes to purchase. Both are 2000 sq ft, both in good locations, both in good neighborhoods. House A could be purchased at $180000 but needs $60k in work to be updated. It has a nice fenced yard and when finished would be worth $260k-$270k. We'd need a rehab loan for that one. House B is one year old, needs no work aside from making a secondary parking area more accessible (it's elevated). It has mountain views and could be purchased at $255k and is worth $270k. Which should we pick?

6060,realestateinvesting,What is good cash flow?,"Have not invested yet, but have questions about what you all consider to be solid cash flow? I'm sure it is different depending on the market, but I'll use an example I'm encountering. 

Mortgage on a 4-plex in Clarksville, TN would be roughly $1800/mo after a 4% FHA loan (allowed on 4-plexes?) with the assumption I live in a unit. These units rent for about $700 conservatively based on similar construction in the neighborhood. So...

$700 x 4 = $2800

$1000/mo after mortgage payment of $1800.

Cash flow of $250 per unit. Is that too low to be worth it? 

The price per unit is $300,000/4 = $75,000 so basically it is $250/mo cash flow on a $75,000 home

What do you guys average on cash flow per unit?

Also if there are any investors in the area, I would love to hear about your experiences and recommendations.

6061,realestateinvesting,How's your market? Any slowdown?,"I've been reading articles recently about the top tier markets slowing down (San Francisco, Miami, etc). 


In Houston, it's been slowing down for the last 2 years but that's due to oil price declining and hasn't been nearly as bad as I expected. Prices fairly stable but higher inventory and the rental market is pretty much a mess. 


In a smaller Midwest market that's been very hot the last few years, I'm seeing a bit of a slowdown also. It's taking longer to rent units and houses seem to stay on market long enough to cut price at least once.

6062,realestateinvesting,Pay off auto loan or invest in another rental property?,"I debated on posting this thread in /r/personalfinancing but thought maybe it would be more useful here. I currently owe about $29,800 on my truck that has an interest rate of 5.19% (high, I know). I net about $3,800/mo before bills (that's after my 401k and HSA contributions as well). 

My truck payment is about $550 and I've been paying extra every month for the total to equal $1k/mo in hopes of paying it off early (bought the truck in 01/2016).

I currently have a mortgage that is about $900/mo and my neighbor was talking about selling his property (it's a townhouse that will roughly go for $136k). I'm now in a dilemma where I have to decide, do I save that extra $450/mo to buy another property sooner (so I can buy more properties) or do I pay off my auto loan early, potentially in 2.5 years give or take some months.

I should mention that my mortgage and truck are my only debt. I just want to put my money where I'll get the most return. I plan on moving out and into the new investment so I would likely get an FHA loan with 3.5% down as well as a low interest rate. The going rate for rent in the neighborhood is about $1200. I know there are a slew of other factors to consider like repair rate, cap rate, vacancy rate, etc. But I'm interested in opinions on the whole, debt vs investment.

The house is now worth around $120K, and I owe a little less than $60K on it in a 30-year fixed mortgage.  

I'm interested in pulling out about $30K in equity. The house will still cash flow with a slightly higher mortgage payment, and I plan on keeping the cash on hand so I can pick up another property when I see a good opportunity.  

So--will I have to pay taxes right away on the equity I pull out, or not until I sell the house?  

I know when I sell I can look into a 1031 exchange to delay paying taxes on the appreciation, but I have long-term tenants in there and I like the area and I'm not inclined to sell in the near future.

6069,realestateinvesting,Just picked up a new rehab!,"Pretty excited over here. Our team just picked up our fourth flip of the year. Still haven't fully decided on whether we're adding an extension or renovating as is; both are great options. Here are the numbers without the extension. 

Purchase Price: $160,000.00

Repairs: $35,000.00

ARV: $260,000

We're using private money to fund the purchase price and are luckily able to self-fund the repairs on this one. It's currently a 3/1.5, we'll be making it a 3/2 at a minimum. The extension on the back could give us another $30,000-$40,000 in value but would probably cost right around there. The biggest thing it would do is potentially help it sell quicker.

this house did not flood in the recent flooding

new opportunity house is for 85K, spoke with the agent as the seller is in another state and just want to get rid of the house.

seller agreed to provide me with payoff amount on the mortgage, 77K, the house really worth 65K to 70K in my mind, it is a smaller hour 988 spft and everything around it is 1200-1500 sqft comparable homes price per sq ft is $57 while this one is at $85 , the house has window ac and central heat system, should i add central AC? im planning to do it if i will increase rent is that is a good idea?

i think this house can be a good option if i end up not paying any down payment or maybe 1K down payment

the house currently rented for 950 a month, on month to month basis as the tenant is there for over a year

my thought process options

1- offer to get the house for the payoff amount and maybe give 1K cash to owner and refinance( can i refinance the house right after i acquire the mortgage? or do i need to wait?). this will bring my mortgage roughly to $380 a month with total cash out of maybe 1K, rent is 950 so gross income is $570, keeping 50% of rent for maintenance etc that brings me to 285 monthly which is not bad, in case i want to use a management property firm that 10% of 950 = 95 so im down to $190. do i have to calculate home insurance with this calculations?seller claim his monthly mortage payments is $750 which do not sound right to me! thoughts?

2- offer 68K only with nothing else and let the seller deal with it. keep the tenant etc.

3- the house can rent for $1100 maybe $1200 should i find another tenant

4- walk away

what other method will guys use to handle this situation?

how do you guys calculate the numbers for investments? i need to check bigger pockets and thats for sure.

im meeting with the agent tomorrow to see other options and maybe provide an offer

6078,realestateinvesting,Tax Havens,"With the 2016 presidential campaign drawing to a close, it's becoming quite clear that Hillary will be our next president. As a result, there will likely be a spike in income tax and capital gains rates once she assumes office. That said, intelligent aristocrats and capitalists will seek to lower tax rates by any means necessary, including moving to foreign tax havens.

Will we see a significant rise in the property values of these tax havens--Cayman Islands, Switzerland--after Hillary's stringent fiscal rates are implemented? Or are the premium values mostly built into these markets already (and have been so for decades)? Surely I can't be the first person to consider this.

I work in real estate development so I understand (to some degree) proformas, budgeting, and financing (think more back office stuff). I lack knowledge of how to inspect a property to see if the structure is sound. How can I tour a property + ask the right questions so that I don't, for example, buy a house with major water damage? Are sellers mostly honest about stuff like this, or is it buyer beware? I'd assume the latter "
6080,realestateinvesting,Question about Rich Dad books,"Hey community,

I'm trying to get into real estate investing, specifically owning two- or multiple-family buildings and using the rent for income.  I've never owned real estate, so I know I've got a lot to learn.

I've been reading a couple books lately, specifically **""The ABCs of Real Estate Investing""** and **""The Advanced Guide to Real Estate Investing,""** both by Ken McElroy.  They are part of the Rich Dad Advisors line of books.

Have any of you read these books? Do you have an opinion of the advice they give?  They really push for you to invest in real estate, almost so much that it seems like the author would have something to gain if I invest in real estate, which is why he's saying it's so good to invest in it.  Almost seems too good to be true.  But I don't think the author would gain anything if readers invest in real estate.  In actuality, I'd imagine we would just be competition and could theoretically hurt him if we invested.

Long story short, are multiple family homes the best possible investment?  Are the tax incentives as great as the books say? (they discuss claiming depreciation on the homes and 1031 transfers)



tl;dr Have you read the rich dad books in bold above?  are they accurate?"
6081,realestateinvesting,First steps towards learning more about a property I like,"I'm an aspiring investor starting from square one.  Based on what I've read, I'm excited to put together a capable team I can trust.  An investor friend has suggested an agent and an attorney I can consider, and that's good.  I've reached out and will seek others online, go to my local REIA meeting, and seek pre-approval from a lender.

In the meantime, I've found a property that I like online, and I'm curious how I can learn more about it.  I'm not sure if I should focus on finding the ""right"" team first, quickly contact an arbitrary agent to learn more about the property and the purchasing process, or attempt to contact the seller directly.  

Contacting a seller seems like a huge red flag with my lack of experience.  At the same time, I see the sidebar refer to relationship skills, excellent communication, and critical thinking, and these are the skills I value most in my personal and professional lives.  Speaking with someone and listening (actually listening) to their situation is what I do, and if I had some experience under my belt, I feel I'd have much more control over the process via direct contact. Of course, I'm certain that working with a capable industry professional has many perks as well.  Having never been through this, I'm not sure- perhaps the two are not exclusive.

I would like take some kind of action while this property is still available.  How would you suggest I proceed with this property and in general?

Many thanks in advance!"

6083,realestateinvesting,First two years and wondering where to go now,"I started at my current job (airline pilot) in 2011 (24 at the time, 29 now) and it seemed right off the bat, many of the guys I flew with were in real estate investing. During the course of the trips, I would hear stories of how they got into real estate investing and they encouraged me to do it as well.

Like many here, I thought to myself ""Well this seems easy enough: buy a property, get tenants, collect rent...but there has to be a lot more to it."" I went to an investing group (which I found not super welcoming to new comers), read books and talked it over with my wife. As everyone I spoke to said, it really is that straight forward.  

The best thing that happened was I contacted our family's realtor who helped my family before I was even born and she put me in contact with a realtor in the area I wanted to invest in - Rockford IL. I chose Rockford because while I live in Chicago, I didnt have the start up capital to work in Chicago or the suburbs but I could in  Rockford and while the tax rates were higher and the income lower, I could at least get started.

While the single-family house I bought required some cosmetic TLC that my wife and I both put the effort into (as well as some professional things - I don't do plumbing) eventually we got it ""rent-ready."" I paid cash for it which helped keep the cost down. It was listed for 46,000 and my offer of 42,000 cash was accepted. I guess I should have offered lower?

Anyways, I eventually got tenants in and have a property manager who rents it at $850/month - tenant pays all utilities and the manager charges 10%. 

So in short, my first rental property has worked out well for the first 2 years. In general, it was as easy as they say but having the initial capital up front helped a lot to avoid dealing with the banks/etc.

tl;dr: first rental property worked out pretty good.

Now I am wondering where to go from here. I would like to get into multi-unit places. Right now, I do not have the initial capital to even afford a down payment on such a place. One idea that had crossed my mind was selling my current place. Even if I sold my current property for what I bought it (and Im sure I could make a little more), that would give me lets just say $40,000. That would allow me to buy a $200,000 property assuming paying 20% down.

Alternatively, I could see if I could get a loan out against the house (would a bank do that on such a low priced house?) and use that as a down payment on another property - the two loan payments would be doable if at least one property was rented out. If both were vacant, it would also be doable but strain both my wife and my income.

Other option would just be to save up for a down payment on another single family home and buy that with a loan.
Thats my idea for the next step but I am wondering what others think. 

tl;dr: I own a single family home, paid in full, currently rented and looking at next step."
6084,realestateinvesting,Selling a CFD,So I have a rental property I am looking to sell. It appraises out just fine and has renters in it. Basically I am going back to school and could use the cash. My renters want to buy it but her credit isn't good enough to qualify (620'ish I think and the house wouldn't go FHA). If I did a CFD with them for like $105k with $10k down could I just turn around and immediately sell the CFD to get my cash out? And if so what is the process/price for doing this?

6088,realestateinvesting,How do groups of people invest in property together if the following situation happens?,"Here's the issue I'm running in to:  I own 50% of a 4 unit property that is very cash positive.  My partner and I did a refi and pulled out some cash.  With my half, I'm looking at investing in another multi unit property that I would own 100% of.  Here's the problem:  I can't get financed for the second property because I'm being hit for 100% of the mortgage liability on the property I own 50% of.  I'm only claiming 50% of the income from the property I currently own on my taxes because of owning half of it.   Is there any work around?  

Some numbers:  Property I own 50% of is valued at $870K, loan amount is $640K, mortgage is $3900/mth, rents bring in $5900/mth.  Property I'm looking to buy is $145K, I'd put down 25-30%.  It's also a 4 unit property (in a much cheaper area) and brings in $2200/mth.  My mortgage with 25% down at 4.35% (which I was originally quoted before this issue came up) would be about $800.  My income from my job is about $70K per year.  I don't own the place where I live, so I have $975/mth in rent.  Using all those numbers it seems quite obvious that I can afford this, but again, I'm not able to get a conventional loan because of the liability of my current $640K mortgage.

I'm looking in to private lending, but don't want to pay 8% when I was originally quoted 4.35%.  If I could find private lending at 6% would it be worth it?  Should I sell the property I currently own 50% of?  It seems stupid to sell that property as it's 1 mile from the beach in San Diego, the rents will continue to climb, and (hopefully) the place will continue to appreciate in value (it's gone up 50% since we bought it in 2011).  I really don't want to sell the current property, but feel ""stuck.""  

Any advice?  Thanks so much everyone!   "
6089,realestateinvesting,buying Condos with intention of renting,"i am looking to diversify and get some rental income going in my portfolio.  i found a couple condo complexes with units that seem to be decent deals.  Of course this is making some assumptions; close the deal and rent almost immediately, buy slightly under ask, occupied 100% for the 12 month duration of tenant#1, tenant pays every month, and doesn't destroy the place.  Expenses are monthly HOA, real estate taxes, a reserve for repairs and accounting fees equal to one month of rent which is reasonable after talking to several agents, and insurance.

Going in 20cash/80mortgage at 4%, its cash flow positive which works out to be the equivalent of 2 months of current market rent.  This results in a cash on cash return of 15%.

Going in 100cash/0mortgage, the cash on cash (and total return) would be 7.9%, and works out to 5 months of rental income.

So to this point, it looks good to me in either scenario, since its assuming 100% occupancy.  Obviously the returns drop off if i say 11/12 month occupancy on the initial tenant.  The 20/80 scenario cash on cash return is now 9.33%, and the 100/0 scenario return is now 6.3%.  I still think there is enough padding in this investment to weather some minor issues like a 1-2 month vacancy between tenants.  And since these are condos, its ""more passive"" than buying a two family since upkeep of the grounds is automated.  

Heres the issues.  The city taxes are rumored to be going up, and are already high (3.25 months of rental income).  The property values at at 50% of 2008 highs, and are trending lower in the last 18 months.  So Im assuming in 5 years the principal value will have declined by as much as 10% if this trend continues.  The other concerns are just the basics - first time landlord, dealing with finding tenants, and a HOA that could raise monthly expenses.  

Anyone want to weigh in or offer advice?

6090,realestateinvesting,Quick refinance question,"So I currently have a mortgage on my house, I owe about 50k at 3.3%.  

I'm looking at buying a rental for which I need to borrow 40k, and the current rates I'm getting are 5.1%.(due to smallness of the loan)

If the numbers work out and I buy the new property, is the a reason against immediately consolidating the debt for a lower rate?  Or keep them separate and just pour any extra cash into the higher rate?  Or anything else that I'm not thinking about?

The only argument against I can think of, is either I can't get a significantly better rate, or bookkeeping becomes a bit harder in terms of determining if my property is profitable. 

I don't currently have an LLC or anything, so both are in my name.

Other factors:  I'm late 20s, have a 100k job, so am able to pay both off fairly quickly if I concentrate on it.

Thanks for any help, this sub has been great so far.

In October I'll be receiving a windfall of ~100-150k and will become owner of an entirely passive Residential property that the tenant runs a business out of.

I do plan on using a property manager if I am able to find one I'm comfortable working with.

We are not sure what is the best way to proceed with this to maximize a return for us. We currently live rent free in a garage apartment due to a medical issue that we had to pay out of pocket for. We are going to move into this house, make some minor updates, add a bathroom (my dad is a contractor and is helping with that) and then we are stuck about what to do. Continuing to live rent free in our garage apartment is not really an option because we really want our own space again.

Do we sell the house after a year, and then move into another house we want to fix up and sell?

Do we stay in this house, try and buy another investment property and fix and sell it? 

Do we move into another house and rent this house out?

6100,realestateinvesting,Refinancing on this mess.,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask these questions but I am at a loss. My business partner and I have made a bunch of mistakes, but I think we are on the right track. Now it's time for us to fix them and I need some advice. We operate in a college town with sky rocketing rents.

1. December 2015 my partner and I put in 15k each for a total of 30k down on two houses(one loan) for ~120k. We were both having trouble finding financing, and the fledgling LLC we started had no credit. However, we knew we wanted these houses. After desperately searching around we found an interest(%11) only loan from Mr. Money Bags greasy loan guy. So now we are paying $920 a month with nothing going towards the principal. There are no prepayment penalties. We still owe about 90k.

2. After putting about 5k into fixing the houses up they are both renting marvelously. One is renting for $1200 and the other for $1400. We are clearing about $1700 a month and the money is just building in the account. At six months we have about ~10k in checking.

3. We were in such a rush to buy the houses that my partner put them in his name to smooth out loan process. As part of the refinancing we would like to put them either in both our names, or in the name of the business.

My credit is poor 590-620 and I have only had my current job for 2 months. My partners credit is better 700+ but his income is low and he already has a personal mortgage for his own home.

TLDR: ~$900/m mortgage on  one 3 year interest only(11%) loan with a balance of 90k on 2 houses. $2600/m income from rents. $10k in bank. 6 months into loan.

We want a better loan and to put title in businesses name. Banks wont even humor us. Our cash flow is good enough for one of the houses to justify it IMO so I am at a loss. "
6101,realestateinvesting,Creative ways to use equity in non-primary home,"I've recently ventured into the world of real estate investing and looking to utilize my cash + leverage the best way possible given my situation. 

I have enough cash to afford a down payment on a property, but probably not enough to afford 2 unless I did one FHA and another 5-10% down. 

I own a home outright that a family member occupies that's worth approx $200k. It is not my primary residence.

Been thinking of creative ways to leverage the equity in the home. I thought about getting around a 203k/reno loan by taking out a home equity loan for a fixer-upper, but since it is not my primary residence I'm getting quoted in the 6% range. Doesn't make sense. 

I have a relationship with someone who is doing well rehabbing properties who needs capital. Can arbitrage by taking out a HELOC at around 3-4% and lending it at 10%, paying it back in a year or less. Obviously there is signifcant risk involved and I understand that.

6107,realestateinvesting,Rent my home or buy an investment property?,"Hi–

I'm trying to develop a 5-10 year plan for myself. I see a few paths forward and am looking for some advice as I'm relatively new at this. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Background:

I'm 31, live in the Bay Area (CA). Have a 30y fixed mortgage @3.75% with 10% down that i'm 4 years into. Property value has appreciated significantly, as you might expect. I have been saving diligently as well – probably half the way towards a downpayment for a new property.

Path 1:

Refinance to 15 year, and work towards renting out my existing home. Looking at refi because expected rent would exceed refinanced monthly payment. If the market is still high when I begin renting it, I would likely rent myself until the market drops a bit, all while saving as much as I can, so I'll be ready to buy again when the market is better for buyers.

Path 2:

Keep saving and patiently look for a good deal on a rental property. Live in existing home until it becomes impractical (will outgrow this house when I have kids in ~6 yrs ??). Use rental income to grow savings and continue to invest in real estate without getting personal property involved.

Basically I think my question comes down to best use of my existing property. Is it best to hold onto it and rent it out when it's no longer the best place for me to live? Considering I bought it in 2012 (a much better buyers market), should I treat the property more as an asset and work to rent it out sooner rather than later?

Again, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

Where we are, you can find an updated 1,300 sqft home in a nice neighborhood for 120k - 150k. We have been saving up for a rental property for a couple of years and unfortunately, now, when we finally have enough money for a down payment, we find that deals are rare and disappearing very quickly. Most neighborhoods are marked ""Hot"" to ""Very Hot"" on Zillow. Foreclosures are like rare Pokemons, and most of them sell for a whole lot more than it's worth to buy and fix up. 

Based on what we learned from sources like Bigger Pockets podcasts, we hope to earn from 10 - 15% cash on cash ROI after accounting for expenses and mortgage. Here's the reality that we are facing: for SFRs, 10% is none existent, and for multi-family, the ROI we want will definitely be in a war zone. That beautiful 20% ROI was common in the 2009 - 2015 period when there were a ton of foreclosures &amp; everything sold cheaply, but they just no longer exist in today's market. 

Question: Is it wise for us to suck it up and purchase something that's lower ROI ( 7 - 8% ) and get started on REI (ppl on BP kept saying you just have to start, sooner the better), hence compromising on our return criteria, or should we wait until the market slows down (winter, next crash, etc) for a better deal?

My pitch is that I can help them sell their homes in as-is condition, and they won't have to spend the time or money to make it ready for a retail sale.  One owner in particular is ready to move out of her home and into a retirement community, so she gave up on updating the house a few years ago.

I've made about 15 offers so far, all have been turned down.

Everyone's primary objection has been ""your price is far too low.""  They say they see sky-high prices in nearby neighborhoods, and that ""they're not going to give their house away like that.""  Although I know the comps in their particular neighborhood aren't as good as the ""nearby neighborhood,"" and I know the condition wouldn't allow for a high price anyways, I try to focus on the solutions I can offer instead.  My response has been to reiterate the options of selling now in as-is condition, or spending tens of thousands to update their house to sell with a realtor, and then *maybe* they'd be close to getting to those higher price brackets.  Given those options, they say they'd rather stay in their homes until they get a higher offer.

Put simply, I'm talking with a lot of tire-kickers.

Is there a way I can adjust the pitch to sound more appealing to them?  Should I re-focus my marketing to find more motivated sellers?  Any other thoughts?"

6121,realestateinvesting,Lease to own option and details on how to finance.,"I am looking to purchase a vacation rental unit through a lease to own option.  I have been working with the seller for over 3 months trying to use any method besides traditional financing.  The unit is more then I am able to traditionally finance at this time.  I have tried to secure a deal with a wraparound mortgage but the seller did not feel comfortable with the original mortgage and the due on sale clause.   So we came to the agreement of a Lease to own option.

Here are the numbers:
Option price of $510,000
lease term 2 years 
$25,000 initial equity payment
$1000 monthly rent
$1200 monthly equity payment

The unit has a rental history for the past four years gross between $40,000 - $47,000

Personal information
740+ credit score
$103,000 salary from full time job
Current personal DTI ratio 28%

4 other rental properties NET $2200 a month

I know someone will ask why the seller would agree to my terms with those gross rental numbers.  He had a rental management company that was taking 55% of gross rental to manage the property.   I will be self managing the unit. 

My question is what do I need to do to purchase this property after I have built up some equity and capital with traditional financing?  Can I use rental history of the vacation property as evidence to help secure a loan when I am not the owner?  Are there any other options of financing then personal financing?  Any info or even a good starting point on who to talk to would be much appreciated.

He suggested a land contract, but that will have the same issues as assuming the mortgage - I'd own the property, and the mortgage would still be in his name. So I'm thinking a lease option. Lease it at the mortgage amount + proposed 2nd. That also would hedge me against rate increases(since his mortgage is an ARM).  Or could structure it a different way - less monthly, with a balloon in 5-10 years.

6134,realestateinvesting,Where to invest: Rental Property vs Stock Market,"I am a Realtor in Southern Ontario. Given my knowledge of the RE market and ability to save commission on the purchase and sale of investment property, I always thought I should just collect as many cashflow positive properties as I could find to grow my retirement fund.
However, recent reading/learning has taught me to diversify to buffer against changes in the market. I am already heavily weighted in RE through owning my home (w/ rental income) and from my income depending on the health of that industry. So now I'm thinking it would be better to diversify and invest my savings in ETFs.

6135,realestateinvesting,Owner finance opportunity on 4 plex. Help on numbers,"I had someone contact me about selling their fourplex. They're not super motivated, but it could be a decent deal. He won't give me a number, so I have to make an offer.   
  
Rents - Owner says 950(2BR),950(2BR),1450(3BR),1850(4BR). Those are way high. I think one of the 2BR is on craigstlist for 800 right now. My numbers look more like 800, 800, 1150, 1350. Those may be a bit conservative, but I'd rather go that side. So $4100 a month. Also says $125 a month from laundry  
  
Projected yearly expenses:  8% vacancy - $3900, Taxes - $4200, Insurance - $2400, PM@ 8% - $3900 -Maintenance - $4k - Trash/water $4k, Gas - $2300, and CapEx - $3200   
  
Leaves me at $44.7k in, and $24k out, leaving $20k for mortgage. I'd probably assume his, then pay him on top of that. I may also drop the prop management and do it myself. Rents could be $25-50 higher on each unit.  
  
What do you guys think? A virtually identical property(same sq footage, same year built, same layout, and a block and a half away) sold in February for $309500, and another for $300k in Sept 2014. He bought it for $370 in 2004. Making some wild guesses He might still owe $250-270k.   
  
I guess it depends on what his mortgage payment is, and how much he's willing to take. He's open to owner financing. What do you all think makes sense? Depending on down payment, it could be a good way to get into a prop with little out of pocket.

6136,realestateinvesting,Update to Talk me off the ledge: we are cancelling the apocalypse!,"The two properties that I though we for sure going to be vacant in August, I just got leases signed on them.  

One tenant will for sure be gone in 7 months, but at least it's 7 months from now.  Probably going to be a little princess, but that just means I get to upgrade the place and raise the rent next year, that unit will support it.

The other one (that's not section 8 because they won't approve it) is likely to be a constant thorn but I wrote it into the lease that I will come in and change the AC filters every month, so at least I'll get a look inside.  Seriously, when someone says they are disabled but they appear to by physically okay, it's probably a mental disability.  God this woman is dumb.  The lights are on but no one home. My application says ""please provide proof of income, a recent paystub showing the period being paid or at least 2 months bank statements.  She's somehow totally incapable of taking a digital picture and sending it, sent me picture after picture of out of focus, amounts cut off the edge, not what I asked for pictures, so many that I was thinking either she's really putting a lot of effort into a con job or she's severely handicapped.  Then, when I met up with her in person she just handed the papers to me as plain as day, everything I'd asked for, disability income and child support and foster care subsidies adding up to more than I make.  

And the Air conditioning unit wasn't that busted, my hero of an AC guy resurrected it.  Again.

And it turns out that Pergo flooring is not really that difficult to pull out half the room and put down new, then re-nail the repainted quarter-round.

6137,realestateinvesting,Dealing with insurance and contractors,"Hello folks, I'm looking for some advice from people who have dealt with insurance/contractor issues before.

Here's what happened:

My property was hit by a car, and it made a huge hole in the garage, which requires replacing the siding (2x4s, stucco, and paint).
The independent inspector comes out and approximates the damages at $10,000. My deductible is $1000, so I get a check for $9000. Everything is ok so far.


I invite several contractors to give bids, and here comes the problem - most of them want to work directly with the insurance and do not want to give me a dollar amount for their bids. One of them literally said ""Don't worry about the dollar amount. We'll figure it out with the insurance together."" I find this ridiculous because it seems like they can do the job for a lot cheaper, but would like to keep the difference. If anyone gets to keep the difference, it should be me, right?

Have any of you experienced this before? Are there any concerns with hiring a handyman, paying them hourly for their work, and then keeping the rest of the insurance money? I'd like to keep everything legit and not unintentionally commit insurance fraud or something, but I feel like these contractor companies are taking advantage."

6143,realestateinvesting,Cash on cash formula,"First off, really enjoying this sub and learning a lot. 

In order to see if a property is a good investment I have been building some excel sheets with built in formulas to compare properties. For the ""Cash on cash"" value, or basic return on your money I'm not sure I have it locked in. 

My understanding:

  Cash in is simple:every penny that you have spent (down payment, rehab, maintenance, property management etc)

Cash out is more complicated. I am considering this all equity that has been bought in the house, plus any additional profit. What this means is of the mortgage payments you've made (presumably covered by the rent) only the principle that you paid counts. All maintenance, mortgage interest, property management fees, etc, is basically loss. 

The one grey area would be work that may add value to the home (such as replacing carpet with tile, fixing anything that increases the home value from what you initially paid)

Does this seem correct?  Am I missing anything significant?

Does this seem like a decent way to evaluate an investment property? (With other factors obviously included)

I'm a newer investor and I am having a hard time figuring out direction and what to do next. I currently own two sfh rentals. One costs about $900/month in total expenses (15 year conventional loan) and rents for $1150 (but will be increasing to $1250). We owe about $75k (bought it for $120k, 20% down) and it is worth $220k. I own half of it, along with my parents. The other costs us about $800/month (30 year conventional) and rents for $1300. We owe about $95k (paid $136k, put 20% down) and it's worth around $210k. While we technically put 20% down, we really only out 10% down on the property we own together with my parents, and got a loan from my inlaws for the 20% on the other property, which we figured was better since we are leveraging someone else's money. I live in a house that costs about $1000/month in expenses and could rent for about $1400, with about $50k in equity. I have been unable to unlock any of the equity in the houses because we show very little income, but we do have very good credit. What is the best thing to do going forward? We are considering buying a new home to live in that we can put a little work into and then sell so that we can rent out our current home (but this doesnt address our main problem, which is increasing income) or buying a small ~$90k home to flip and then rent/sell. Ideally we would like to flip (father in law is a contractor and we can do most of the work ourselves) a house or two every year to make an extra $30-$50k to buy additional rental properties for long term investment. I'm assuming holding on to the current rentals is the smartest decision, but not accessing the equity is keeping us from moving forward as we don't have a lot of cash and income (I work part time as a Realtor). My main goal is to increase income. We would consider any type of real estate investing, but just don't know where to start. I appreciate any advice!"

Water heater was leaking, tiny leak slowly flooded my Pergo floor.  She didn't say anything until I came by for the scheduled move out inspection.

3.  Unit 3 tenant just moved in a month ago on a year lease, decided that she'd rather live with her boyfriend and not pay rent.  She's leaving so that place will be vacant next month.

6149,realestateinvesting,Looking on advice for setup of rental properties,"Background: In the past I've done a few rental properties and flips. Not a ton, all on the site. However, in the past 8+ years I've only managed a few rentals, no new purchases. I'm posting because I'm assuming things may have changed a bit on recommendations.  
Current: For income properties I own 2 properties.   
Property 1 - Held in an S Corp. Rented by the S Corp which repays us each month on a loan for its purchase.  
Property 2 - Own personally (used to be personal residence). S corp manages it, takes lease income and some profit; pays us the remainder as a lease (which pays the mortgage attached).  
What I have setup right now is a bit inconsistent with one property owned by the business and the other personally. I'd like to get that cleaned up but more importantly in a few months or so we're coming into some money, enough to purchase another 2-4 properties. What I want to do is get enough income from these properties that I start paying myself a salary and quit the 9-5. With that I'm starting to look at company structure and setup.  
My question; what is the suggested business structure to setup these days? The cash to buy the new properties will be in my name so to purchase within the company I'd need to loan the company the money but buying properties within the company proves harder to qualify etc. In the past people have said to buy yourself and then transfer title into the company but I'm always afraid the lender will call the note if I do that. I guess to narrow down the scope here these are my specific questions for the braintrust.  
1) Should I be using the company to purchase the property?    
2) If so then is a S corp reasonable or should it be something else?  
3) If so how is everyone getting the properties into the company name without issues with the lender?  
4) If it shouldn't be in the company then what; a trust, personally with the business doing the management on it?  
Looking for any advice on the best structure today as I believe it may have changed since I was buying previously. Or at least looking for a point in the right direction on options to look into. Thank you.

6159,realestateinvesting,July Deal: 10yr Lease w/ Option to Purchase,"Hi all! I completed my second deal of the year at the beginning of July and have a bit of time to share.

This particular opportunity that I converted to a deal is my 5th lease with option to purchase in a row. I have no idea...well actually I do...why these have all gone the lease option route.

Subject House: Small 3/1 block home (940sq ft) with a covered porch and covered car port which brings the total square footage to 1100 or so. There is a 12 x 12 workshop/shed in the back yard. Yard is fenced and across from a pond.

This particular home is in an area that I haven't had a desire to invest in. On one hand it is near a University and other ""nice"" businesses. On the other also features pockets of ghetto and is known as a highly transient neighborhood. That being said there are also pockets of well maintained, primarily owner-occupied homes in the area.

I came about this particular home when an investor I knew put out a plea back in May for, ""Can someone check my house at xxx address and let me know if my tenant is still there?"" This particular investor lives at least an hour away from the subject property. I like to assist people when I can so I sent one of my handymen over there and sure enough...tenant was still there. I passed on the information and that was that.

About three weeks later I asked the investor what had happened and she said the tenant had left the premises and they were fixing up the home. At this point in time I asked the question that determined if I'd look into this property in greater detail, ""Why did you buy an investment property more than an hour from your normal stomping grounds?"" Her answer, ""It was a good deal.""

I understand many investors live in areas where return on capital makes investing not feasible and you have to look elsewhere. This particular investor lives in one of the hottest places to invest in my state. She made what I consider a classic investing mistake: She bought because it was a good deal but didn't have a good plan. Now I've certainly acquired properties that I didn't want...however I always knew someone who would want that property or I could trade it for a property I did want.

At this point in time I knew:

A) The property was an inconvenience because of location.

B) She didn't have any handymen in the area to work on the property.

C) She had made a good deal on the property...which led me to believe that there was enough profit in the property so we could create a win/win...and I was correct.

This investor had bought the property with financing for 43k cash. She had been renting it for $950 a month. After some negotiation our deal ultimately ended up as follows:

Ten year lease with option to purchase the property. Option price of 75k. Option consideration of 5k (The amount I paid to option the property...so at closing I would owe 70k). Monthly payments of $700 a month. I've already rented the home to a nice, older couple for $1050 a month.

My net cash flow is $350 per month. If I have no repairs or vacancies my one year cash on cash will be: $350 x 12 = $4200 / $5,000 = 84% cash on cash return. I'll have all my initial investment property within 15 months if there are no repairs and the tenants stay. I like that.

As an added bonus, what my fellow investor seemed to not be aware of, was literally the exact same house...4 doors up and 1 street over just sold for 110k. With my strike being 70k I'm very pleased.

So, let's review why this deal took place:

The ""Seller"": I solved the challenge another investor had. She is still making $250 a month off the property (as far as I can tell) and what she owes on the home decreases each month while my strike place remains the same. She WANTS me to hold the property for the full ten years.

The deal ended up making sense to me because of good cash flow, low capital risk and I will likely have a nice spread between my price and what the house could sell for. I also found a nice, quiet pocket of homes in an area of town that is hit or miss.

My ultimate plans for the home: The house is about 24 minutes from where I live...making it the investment property furthest from me. If I can find a house that I like better, I would happily trade this house to ""move up"". My current plane is:

1) Buy the house with the IRA of a friend. My current price would be 70k but I'm going to ask the ""Seller"" if they will take 65k. I would then buy the house with a friends IRA for 80k. This would put 15k tax free into my pocket and it should still net $350-ish a month.

2) I'll actively look to trade the house since it has good (private) financing on it. I could also sell it on a wrap to another investor and take 10k down and keep the difference between the two loans.

It will be interesting to see how I move forward with the home.

6161,realestateinvesting,My call with Clayton Morris' company.,"I had my call with Clayton Morris' company today and a few people asked me to report back so here it is.  

Unlike the other poster who replied to my initial thread I didn't speak with Clayton directly, but with one of his cronies.  The guy was very nice and I never felt like I was being sold anything.  It was strictly an informational call.  He answered all my questions to the best of his ability.   

The tl;dr of Clayton's deal is that he started buying rental properties and after buying, fixing up, and renting a couple properties his mother gave him $40,000 and said ""hook me up with one of those.""  (Paraphrasing.)  Then several friends did the same, and Clayton realized he could build a business buying cheap houses, fixing them up, and selling them to real estate investors.  So that's what he's doing now.   

The houses are small, typically 900-1100 square feet, and in need of repair.  He picks them up usually for less than $20,000 and then renovates them, usually dropping another $15-$20k into them.  (Crony said they had this down to a science at this point.)  Then a property management company comes in and puts a tenant in the building.  You, as the owner, get paid on the 20th of each month.  10% goes to the property management company.  (Clayton is not associated with the PMC.)  

You have to come to the deal with cash, since the houses in their current state are unmortgageable, if that's a word.  However, after the renovation you can take out a home equity loan and do what you want.  The guy said after the flip the houses typically appraise for $40-$50k, but I realize that's a crapshoot.  

The guy said the houses pull a 12% to 15% ""cash-on-cash"" return.  Can someone ELI5, please?  I don't know what that means or how it's calculated.   

So that's the scoop.  The guy is going to be in touch with me about some personal lender options that they are exploring right now since a lot of the people who contact them are like me and don't have $40,000 burning a hole in their bank account.  "

I work 40 hours/week earning about 140k per year in the IT industry, in addition to 15k from an apartment I rent out of my home. 

My family's background is in construction so being handy myself I did a rehab and flip back in my 20's in the bay area, then moved on to owning a mobile home park in NY with 30 units that did pretty well. Then the bottom fell out after my divorce 8 years ago. Since then I've financially reestablished myself and mostly focused on maximizing my 401k, roth IRA, and childrens' 529 plans. I'm now interested in re-engaging with REI. I've been listening to podcasts, reading this forum, and visiting biggerpockets.com. I'm finding the REI options and opinions dizzying. So I thought rather than trying to determine a suitable path with my dated knowledge, I'd take the opposite approach and maybe get more focused advice to get me restarted.

I have about 300k in retirement accounts, a 75k HELOC, and 25k of cash on hand. I have 3 to 4 days a week to dedicate to this endeavour, but no real estate related social network. I suppose my strengths are time and rehab knowledge. My inclination at this point is towards buy and hold in my local area, however the cost of entry is pretty high. 

What strategies should i consider for my present situation and locale?
Where should i start looking for deals?
I used loopnet.com with success in the past, is this still a useful tool?
How can I reduce risk?
Should I start actively networking on biggerpockets? Has anyone found any success with this forum?

My goal is to cultivate additional streams of income, but I also truly enjoyed managing/maintaining my investments in the past so i suppose this is as much about personal fulfillment as it is monetarily driven."

6171,realestateinvesting,How to deal with legacy rental contracts/get tenants to agree to sign new contracts that are in conformity with the law?,"Hi all,

We are planning on acquiring another property which comes with three existing tenants. The contracts the previous owners signed are just not up to legal standards or our standards. They include invalid clauses regarding cosmetic repairs and invoicing for water, operating and heating costs, the deposits are too small, the terms are confusing and there are hack job addenda that make no sense.

None of this is a serious deal breaker for us but we were hoping to approach the tenants individually and try to get them to sign much simpler, better rental agreements.

The best idea we have presently is to offer some kind of cash incentive together with a story about how the new contracts are better for the tenants, and indeed, there are some ways in which they would be better but also some in which they wouldn't be.

My goal here is not to squeeze the tenants. I just want everything to be on the up and up without the legal uncertainty for us.

6177,realestateinvesting,Rent it or sell it?,"Hello,

I am a rookie real estate investor looking for some advice on the situation I am in. 

Should we continue renting out our SFH or sell it?

My wife and I bought a SFH near a well known college town in 2006 when housing prices were high. In 2011 opportunities arose out of state so we moved. At the time in 2011, the estimate of our house value was much less than what we purchased it for. We decided to rent it out, using a property management company to manage the property since we were moving out of state. 

Details:

	•	Purchased for 270k with a 30 year fixed mortgage

	•	Estimated Value in 2011: 210k

	•	Estimated Value now: 250k

	•	Rental Income: $1700

	•	Property Mgmt Fee: $170

	•	Mortgage, Taxes, Insurance: $1590

	•	Expenses per year: roughly around $1500 (lawn maintenance and other miscellaneous expenses)

	•	Vacancy: None so far. The house is in a desirable location and is easily rented out each year.



You can see that we lose $2200/year on this property. The nice thing is that in the past 5 years, the estimated value of the house has recovered upward of about 40k. My wife and I recently had a baby daughter. My thoughts were that if we hold onto the property for the next 20 years, the mortgage will get paid off by renters. At that point whatever the house is worth to be used for our babies college fund. So we pay $2200/year we have a college fund. 

What do you think? Should I rent or sell this property?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

Cheers,
Len

I've read through some older posts and am hoping some users like /u/rkim777 and /u/gringogrande can offer some advice. I currently own two sfh rentals. One costs about $900/month in expenses (15 year conventional loan) and rents for $1150 (but will be increasing to $1250). We owe about $75k (bought it for $120k, 20% down) and it is worth $220k. I own half of it, along with my parents. The other costs us about $800/month (30 year conventional) and rents for $1300. We owe about $95k (paid $136k, put 20% down) and it's worth around $210k. While we technically put 20% down, we really only out 10% down on the property we own together with my parents, and got a loan from my inlaws for the 20% on the other property, which we figured was better since we are leveraging someone else's money. I live in a house that costs about $1000/month in expenses and could rent for about $1400, with about $50k in equity. I have been unable to unlock any of the equity in the houses because we show very little income, but we do have very good credit. What is the best thing to do going forward? We are considering buying a new home to live in that we can put a little work into and then sell so that we can rent out our current home, or buying a small ~$90k home to flip and then rent/sell. Ideally we would like to flip (father in law is a contractor and we can do most of the work ourselves) a house or two every year to make an extra $30-$50k to buy additional rental properties for long term investment. I'm assuming holding on to the current rentals is the smartest decision, but not accessing the equity is keeping us from moving forward as we don't have a lot of cash and income (I work part time as a Realtor). We would consider any type of real estate investing, but just don't know where to start.

Here's the conundrum. Similar units in my building have sold for 320-340 this past year. Since we want to move to a new city next year, should I sell it when the lease is up and pocket the cash? Or keep renting it out for a hefty cash flow? More details:

It's a new building and needs minimal maintenance, but I'd assume around a 10% fee for a property manager.

The problem is, we live in a part of NJ with a high cost-of-living. The floor for single-family homes is ~$300k, and property taxes are at least $8k/year. Anything less than those numbers are either in a bad area, or the place is dilapidated.

We aren't planning on putting the whole $70k down as we'd like to keep some in reserve, but we also want to be generating a cash return on our investment, rather than just appreciation and equity. I see people mentioning the handful of properties they own, but if we can't recoup our down payment, this would be the only one we ever own. We could look into condos, but with association fees, etc that really eats into returns.

Working in our favor though, my wife recently got her RE license. Just not sure how to go about getting started."
6227,realestateinvesting,Newbee question,"I am selling(possibly) my business to an out of state buyer who is looking for larger acreage and building near my current location.  If I find and purchase, the buyer is willing to enter a 10yr NNN with purchase at the end of lease.  

I have found a property that fits the bill (15 acres and 8000sf shop with office) but the current owner is a little reluctant even though i have made an offer close to what i believe is market price.  The commercial property is mostly not being used and is going to be in disrepair in a few years if not attended to.  

1.  How do i find comps in a market where commercial property is not being bought and sold.  Its very rural here.

2.  To demonstrate I am willing to pay marketprice, should i pay to get an appraisal done?

3.  If i make a new purchase on this property, will the lease terms and lease ending purchase price I eventually set with my buyer be based on appraisal or my purchase price of the property?

4.  We have an attorney that is familiar with acquisitions but should I be talking to a commercial real estate agent about the details of this deal?

I hope this makes sense, as we are new to acquisitions, commercial property leasing and such.

6234,realestateinvesting,Buying a house for myself near college campus and renting remaining rooms to students?,"A little background info first:  I work in the oil industry working an equal time on/off rotation meaning that I am only home roughly 6 months out of the year.  I'm also single with no kids.  I enjoy traveling and since my job gives me large amounts of time off I'm attempting to find a way to invest my money smartly in regards to my living arrangements so I can spend most of my money (after savings) traveling.  My residence being little more than a place to store some of my things.  

Anyways: 

 In Mobile, AL which is the nearest major city to me there is decent sized university (University of South Alabama) with an enrollment of 16,000 students that includes a pretty well regarded medical school. There are 3 bed 2 bath 1970's-1980's era houses pretty close to the school in decent neighborhoods for sale for around $70,000-$80,000. I looked up college apartment rentals and small studio apartments in the area go for around $525 utilities not included. Houses of this nature look like they are renting for around $900-$1100. Saw a few advertisements on Craigslist for people looking for roommates for their house at around $450 a room. 

Alabama has the second lowest property taxes in the nation, a house of this value would only run about $300 a year in taxes. If I mortgage $70,000 at 4.5% that is $375 with taxes, about $475 with insurance. 

Let's say $200 for power. $75 for internet. $50 for water. $75 for general maintenance. That's a total of around $875 a month. 

Looks like I could rent the other two rooms for $400 and throw in all utilities included and if anything that might make it quite the bargain. 

Now of course the downside is living with room mates but really the goal is to just have a place to hang my hat so I can be off traveling and doing whatever when I'm off the rig.  I'd probably even take the smallest room and put a solid core door with a dead bolt on it and basically let them have free reign of the place. Also being as it is an older place I don't have to care about them screwing anything up with parties and what not as when I go to resell it I'd likely do some cheap upgrades (laminate flooring, repaint, etc) to increase the curb appeal. Basically let them tear up the old 1980's interior that I don't care about anyway. 

If it works out expand and buy another place and eventually become a college slumlord king (joking of course). 

Any thoughts or opinions?  Thanks in advance.

6235,realestateinvesting,I am 16 and want to start purchasing buy and hold real estate at 18.,"I've been seriously thinking about doing this since I was 14. I don't want to be rich, I just want to cashflow every month free and clear, so I can travel.



I have seen all the youtube videos, and read a few books. I am aware of the risk, but I want to work really hard at it, and I'm confident something good will come out of it. I am looking at going into this with a friend. We are planning to invest in two counties in South Carolina. Greenville county, and Charleston county. 



We want to start out small and slow with a 35k or below property. I hear these cashflow the best, but are risky because low income tenants might do some damage. The rent will be used to pay mortgage and insurance, and whats left goes into emergency fund in case something needs to be replaced. My first question is, will it be possible to find a rent ready property at this price?



After a while, we want to borrow on the equity on our existing property to invest in another house. I don't plan to invest with him forever. Currently I am working a part-time landscaping job, and will soon pick up steam and work more hours to cover my half of the down payment by the time I turn 18. Another quick question, What do y'all think about holding properties under a business, as opposed to under your name? It's not something that I really need to think about now, but I'm just curious.



Does anyone see any unforeseen costs or circumstances? I know many will say it's too early and I should focus on work, but it will be easy balancing this with a part time job, and college.


THANKS so much ahead of time for any responses."

I recently inherited 400k and a plot of land in the downtown area of my city that used to belong to my grandfather. we just recently demolished the home due to severe issues with the small building that was on it. The plot is about 50ft by 25ft

As myself, I currently live in my own home that I also rent out, 40k left of the mortgage. The tenants pay enough to cover my utilities/tax/mortgage fees. not debts, no kids, no real big issues in life at the moment.


The area of that plot of land is surrounded by rental homes and so I was wondering if its a good idea to use the money to build a rental unit but I also fear that the land may be bought out now because its empty and lots of investors are looking at the downtown.


Any advice? I appreciate all comments and thank you for your time!

6242,realestateinvesting,Have 50K to invest but can't invest in my area,"I currently have 50K in cash to invest. I also own another property which I purchased for 720K and is now worth around 1.4 million. I lived there for a bit but am now renting it out and making about $200 net profit per month off of it.

I would like to invest in more real estate, but the main issue is that properties in my area would require huge capital investments and at 20-30% down, they wouldn't even generate positive monthly cash flow. 

I've been looking at other areas to invest in, specifically Dallas, but I am not exactly sure how to get started finding good deals. What do you usually do to go about finding good deals in certain areas? Also, do you recommend investing in an area that I wouldn't be able to easily travel to? I would to hire a trustworthy property manager in that situation, but not sure how hard that is to find. 

My goal is to find properties where I can make a decent amount in monthly cash flow and potentially get a large return from appreciation (the appreciation isn't as important to me). Looking to set myself up with a bunch of passive income streams to help me retire early. 

I'm also looking for a real estate investing mentor if anyone would be interested in something like that. I have a solid computer science background and would be able to contribute in some ways using that. "

6257,realestateinvesting,Help! Investment Property Prospect.,"I am making a cash offer on an investment property that I intend to rent out.  The amount is $31,000 with $12,000 coming from my own savings, $10,000 from my mom, and $9,000 from my sister.  I plan to take out a Home Equity Loan after purchase to repay the loaned amount from family and for a bit of renovation.  The issue is that the money from my family is cash that they have saved and not deposited into a banking account (against my advice). My mother and sister keep their saved money from their husbands (they don't want their husbands to blow it on cars and vacations). My understanding is that without a verifiable paper trail for these cash deposits, I will not be able to qualify for a loan. The home is a HUD foreclosure and is really worth about $54,000. 

Does anyone know, on average, how many months back a lender will need to verify on my banking account? In other words, how long will I have to wait in order to take out Home Equity Loan for these not to be an issue? Are there any other options for my situation?

6260,realestateinvesting,Best way to structure this purchase? Foreclosure deal with partner (X-post: r/realestate),"Hi everyone,

My partner and I found a very solid (single family) flip opportunity in Milwaukee, WI (where we both live) that just went from a short sale to a foreclosure. I have personally never purchased a flip through foreclosure (FSBO or major value-add's on the MLS are the traditional ways we look to purchase) so I am more used to the traditional 20-25% down type of financing through a bank. It's my understanding that the foreclosure has to be purchased with 100% cash down at the time of the Sheriff's sale but that we could then turn around and expeditiously refinance through one of the local banks we have relationships with - getting us back to the more traditional 20-25% down model that we are used to... pulling back out the majority (75-80%) of our cash. 

  

Let's assume:

- Purchase price of home at the Sheriff's sale: $400,000

- Will be refinancing (financing?) the house as soon as we can in order to pull our cash back out

- 50/50 partnership split between my partner and I ($200,000 in cash needed from each at time of purcahse)

- My partner will be fulfilling his portion (his $200,000) down through a personal line of credit he has with a high net worth relative of his

- I don't have the full $200,000 in cash needed on my end for the initial cash down process at the Sheriff's sale (I have about 1/3rd of that in cash which I will be using as my half of the down payment when we refinance / to have for improvements we need to make for the flip)

  

Saying all of that, my question is: What are the different ways in which I can finance that initial $200,000 of cash down I need on my end for the day of the Sheriff's auction? i.e. Personal line of credit? Business line of credit? Hard money lender? Family loan? etc. A little about me if it helps:

- I have a high-income ""9-5"" W2 job (6 figures +)

- Credit of 740+

- I am a renter (no home/mortgage in my name)

  

I'm curious to hear about all of the different ways I can structure this. My assumption would be that it will only be a few days/weeks that I will need this ~$200k float so I am not too concerned about a high interest rate considering it's short term (before we refinance). 

  
Thanks everyone!"
6261,realestateinvesting,Is one of these a better option?,"So I have two competing scenarios I'm working through and wanted to get the option of folks here...

I bought my current house about 7 years ago and got a pretty good deal on it, today I think it's realistic to say that I have between 35k-40k in equity at a minimum.

My fiancee and I have been planning ahead for our next house and have been saving a large portion of her salary to use as a down payment, for improvements, etc.  We've also talked about getting an income property for more long-term financial stability.  Right now our goal is to buy/move in 2 years, we'll have between 65k-70k in cash to use.

My question becomes, would it make more sense to pay down my current loan, re-finance it and then rent my current place out? Using some conservative numbers, if I paid down an additional 30k in the mortgage then renfinanced it, and took a conservative view of all the other items (vacancy, repairs, taxes, etc) I would be able to generate about $245/mo in cash flow on my current place. That would give me a cap rate of 8.5% a Cash on Cash Return of 9.8%, and gross rent rate of 1.06%. This option would then leave us with the remaining 35k-40k to put down on a new house. The nice thing is that we wouldn't move until we found renters for the first year (since we could stay with my parents while looking for a house), so hopefully that would keep vacancy a non-issue for a bit.

The other option I'm considering would be to sell my current house, use the equity to reduce the new home loan and then use the complete 65k to purchase &amp; rent a different house.

The reason I'm considering doing that is while my home is in an ok neighborhood, the schools aren't the best, and it's in an area that I don't see improving in the type of people who live in the area- mostly lower-middle class, blue collar types. A bit rough but by and large ok.

I'm wondering if it makes more sense from a tax/financial perspective to move my equity from my current place to a new place and then look for a differently investment property, or if it is better to keep the house I have, since I know all about it, and won't have any maintenance/repair surprises, etc.

I can post the actual numbers I used if that matters, and I'm in WI.

TL;DR- Pay down my current mortgage and rent out my current house when I move, or buy a different investment property?"

6264,realestateinvesting,Thoughts on Clayton Morris' company?,"I was wondering what this sub thought of Clayton Morris' [MorrisInvest.com](http://morrisinvest.com/) company.  

Clayton (and yes, this is the guy from Fox and Friends) started a podcast recently about real estate investing, but it's basically just a recurring ad for his company.  

What his company does is provide ""turn-key real estate investing solutions"" buzzword buzzword buzzword.  The tl;dr of it is they buy a property, renovate it (they claim new electric, plumbing, everything), find a renter, and then sell it to you, the investor.  You collect the rent and their property management company handles everything else.  

The properties are supposedly located in areas where there is a stable local economy, a strong rental market, reasonable property values, and low taxes.  He specifically mentioned the Indianapolis area a couple times.  The houses sell for $30k-$40k and rent for anywhere from $450-$650 or so per month.  

This all sounds great, but he seems to be pushing it hard, which makes me think something is up.  He claims to make his money by doing just this, buying and renting property in the midwest while living in New Jersey (as do I).    But I'm curious to know how he's really making his money.  I suspect he is buying foreclosures or run-down properties, fixing them up, and flipping them.  I also suspect he owns the property management company, so for every new buyer he signs up he gets another 10% or whatever of that person's rental income.  So he gets it coming and going.  There's nothing wrong with either of these, but I wish he was more up front about it if that's the case.  

I signed up for their web site and was going to ""schedule a 30 minute call"" with them but their calendar is booked until freakin' July.  So I figured in the mean time I'd see if anyone here has dealt with them or has any thoughts about working with them while I wait to get my questions answered from the source.  

I want to get into real estate investing but currently have no money to use for a down payment.  I may be able to get some, though, through various potential means and buying a $30,000 home in Indiana would be much easier than buying a $300,000 home in New Jersey.  So I'm considering this."

I'm a fairly patient person who doesn't get worked up over much so I waited and about five minutes later John call me back. Apparently the previous owner had used a nail gun to install the baseboard and had impaled a water line. The nail had sealed the hole so there had been no evidence of a leak of any sort. Needless to say, when John pulled off the baseboard, the nail came out as well and we had a fountain spraying onto hardwood floor. Oops.

Fortunately John is fairly quick on his feet and shut the water off averting any sort of disaster. That being said, I've certainly never had an adventure such as this before."

6269,realestateinvesting,Does increased Market Value of a property influence level of Cash on Cash return you are comfortable with?,"I bought a condo in Oakland about 3 years ago. It has appreciated a little over 200k since I bought it- and given the demand for housing in the bay area, I suspect that this will continue to grow quickly over the years. 

I had originally bought it to live in myself, so didn't look at the numbers as an investment property. Now that I'm renting it out, and now that I've learned how to calculate all this stuff using this method https://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/2013/01/19/real-estate-math/ (thanks, subreddit!) it appears i'm making the following:

5% Cap Rate
5% Cash on Cash Returns

From what I have read here and on other blogs, that's not great. 

At next lease renewal I can raise the rent which would increase it ever so slightly. It's a luxury building and can command $4-500 more rent a month, which I will charge when new tenants move in. With the current tenants, I'll raise it only ~$115/4% per month not to be a jerk)

Anyway my question to you is: I'm only getting 5% return now, but if I ever sell the property I stand to double or triple my purchase price. Market dips aside, given this is the bay area and housing is limited, in the long run I still believe this a safe gamble.

It feels like that aspect alone makes it worth keeping- do you agree? "

6271,realestateinvesting,Homeowners with a rental condo: tax consequences and possible conversion of property,"So, we own a family home that is not big enough for all of us in a moderately upscale/touristy small town in Northern CA. We also have a new urban condo in a nearby city that we rent. 

The issue is that our 3br/2ba home is not big enough for our growing family. 

Both our residence and our rental condo have equity that might cover a solid down payment on a new larger home.

There are two routes we could go: 

A) Keep our rental condo and invest in our residence by building a small mother in law for. . . my mother in law. 

OR

B) Convert our residence into a rental and sell the condo. Buying a larger home in a nearby rural/suburban area. 

My question is, if we do the latter can we finance our new home purchase with the sale of the condo and somehow avoid capital gains through a 1031 exchange? IE: on paper the profit from the condo's sale would adhere to our new rental property (our former family home.) Maybe this would entail refinancing our residence?

If this all sounds like gobbledy gook, that's because I don't understand this stuff at all. I've thought about sitting down with a real estate agent and a mortgage broker to discuss, but I have a feeling if we do that, it's a fait accompli, (both of those guys want to get paid right?) 

Any suggestions on good resources for this type of situation? I can't imagine that it's not a common dilemma. .  .

What am I missing?,"My wife and I live in a ridiculously expensive real estate market, but the advantage is that salaries are higher than most of the rest of the US. We've been saving and have enough to put a 20% down payment on a $300k house, but that wouldn't even buy a studio condo where we live. 

We've been thinking that it might make fiscal sense to buy a house in a hot AirBNB market, invest a little to fix it up and outfit it, then rent out the house. Based on prices in many areas we've looked, we'd only need it rented for 6-10 days a month to make the mortgage payment.

I know we'd need to pay an agency to manage and clean the property, but I'm hoping that wouldn't be too outrageous, and AirBNB allows hosts to charge separate cleaning fees.

To me, this all sounds too good to be true. Is it? Are there things I may be forgetting to take into account? Are there any good resources for determining AirBNB occupancy rates or other data to analyze?"
6274,realestateinvesting,5+ Unit Property Financing,"Hey guys,

I don't yet have experience with 5+ unit apartments and I'm hoping to benefit from some of your experience while we wait to hear back from lenders (holiday weekend in the US).

My partners and I are looking to take our first step into properties that will be financed with commercial loans.  We are currently looking at a 28-unit property (7 quads on a single parcel) with a likely sales price of $650,000. Each unit rents for $400/mo on average but we don't have true vacancy or historical rents collected information yet. We intend to buy-and-hold for passive income so making good financing decisions will be based on that model. We have 7 years of history operating 2-4 unit multifamily properties and should be able to satisfy lender requirements in that area, if any.

Here are some questions I'm hoping to benefit from your experience on:

1) I assume we are more likely to be looking at an 3, 5, or 7 year ARM rather than the 30-year fixed rate mortgages we are familiar with.  What types of loan types would you ask a lender about for this type of property?

2) Should I still be looking at a 25% LTV requirement? More/Less?

3) Assuming a smooth transaction, should I reasonably expect to be closing within 2 months? More/Less?

As stated, this is a new facet of the business for me so please bathe me in your knowledge and experience."

6278,realestateinvesting,Purchasing a [rental] property with foundation issues,"Hello,

I am a first time real estate investor looking to purchase a SFH for buy-and-hold and would like some advice.

The tenant must be assumed on purchase, I have done initial screening and he is content upon staying for at least a few more years and is quite a good guy from what I can tell.

The financials are as follows:

- Purchase Price: ~$90000

- Monthly Rent: $750 (+utilities)

- Property Taxes: $136.67

- Mortgage: $293.60

- Insurance: ~$40

- Maintenance: ~$225

With the conservative estimate on expenses (OEP of ~54%), it is positive cash flow of $55 p/m (4.10% CoC).

However, the property is in need of significant work, such as:

- multiple cracks in foundation (leaky basement)

- kitchen disgusting (no cupboard doors, very dirty...etc)

- bathroom leaks (tenant does not use)

So, my main concern is the amount of work the property will need once this tenant leaves. He has expressed that the issues are not of concern to him at this point, so that is long-term stuff.

What are this subreddit's thoughts on this deal?

**EDIT**: Purchase would be conditional on a structural inspection of foundation, with quote to repair (among other things)"

6282,realestateinvesting,Buying studio to use as investment property?,"Having purchased our first apartment in NYC last year (Queens), my wife and I are considering whether it's a good idea to purchase another nearby to rent out.  We have built up a good amount of savings and are +$3k/month cash flow positive.  I'd like to ask if it's sensible to do the following:

There are studios in our neighborhood (one of the top areas of Queens) selling in the $145-$170k range.  For this example, there is one listed for $149,000 with monthly maintenance (covering all taxes, HOA, building expenses, apartment repairs etc.) of $540.
Assuming a 4% mortgage rate, including maintenance the payment is $1,110 per month, with $30k down.  This unit could easily rent out for $1,600 per month.  Subtracting $75 for a ""maintenance"" fund to cover future expenses, that leaves around $415 profit per month.   

Pros/cons of making this investment? The neighborhood is unlikely to experience a housing crash, and values are likely to keep increasing.  We could either put the profit back into the property to pay off the mortgage sooner, or save towards another if this works out.  Appreciate any conversation on this, neither one of us has ever invested in real estate before, but numbers-wise it looks like a decent opportunity.

6284,realestateinvesting,P2P Lending,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone's considered this and what your thoughts are on this. Where I live there are a number of $30-$50k properties, some already with tenants living in them that rent for $600-$800 per month.

I could get a mortgage, but it's difficult to get a mortgage that low. I was thinking of trying Lending Club or something similar to be able to buy a property in cash, and then do a cashout refinance soon afterwards to avoid riding the high interest rate for that long of a time. I have about $15k saved. Having to pay an $900 for the short term loan with a high interest rate wouldn't break the bank for me at all, but maybe there's more to it. I figure after a refinance I could repeat the process with another property if it goes well.

6286,realestateinvesting,"Newbie, need advice on an investment property. Also need a mentor.","Greetings! 
Quick background about myself. At a very young age I was exposed to Real Estate Investing, both its pros and cons, be it through a family member or friends. Unfortunately, life has its own plan for me. I ended up as Software Developer (which I am passionate about), getting married, and having kids. But I always have an itch to invest in REI.

Currently, I reside in Las Vegas and I need advice on my situation. I will try to format my thought process in bullet points so you don't get crit-rolled by a wall of text. Apologies in advance if there are typos and fail formatting, or if these points are not as detailed.


**Our stuff:**  
1. We don't have cash. We will be purchasing using a loan.  
2. Own a SFH, still not paid, but has equity. Which we can leverage for down payment.  
3. My SO's a real estate agent, so we have access to MLS and some pre-MLS properties.  

**What we read/learned/experienced about REI:**   
1. Never buy investment property at FMV. (I assume this works only if you have cash).  
2. I used to do Wholesale with minimal success. Not my cup of tea.  
3. Location, location, location.  
4. Cash Flow is king. Cap rate is debatable.  
5. Never spend your capital. Add to it. (Which I plan to do with the cash flow).  
6. We have a basic - at most, minimal - understanding of how to use debts as leverage.  
7. Through a friend's experience, they lost everything during the crash because they were leveraging all their properties' equity to buy multiple investments. This always scares me.

**What we want:**  
1. Have a positive cash flow. NOT break even. (So I can add to the capital for future investments).  
2. Snowball this purchase (including my own home) to be able to afford more properties in the future (1 to 3 years?).  

**Questions, dilemmas, and thoughts:**  
0. I fear a bubble burst is looming. Should we wait it out?  
1. There is a MFH for sale (at FMV) that we looked at, it has a positive CF (pro forma values). But it's in a not-so-good neighborhood. The tenants' reactions to my questions seems scripted (I feel like they are told to give good review/answers by the owner in exchange for rent discount or something). Is this something we should consider?  
2. Should we consider condos? They have high HOA fees, if those fees gets increased, it will eat on the CF.  
3. Turn key SFH purchase (again, FMV) will just be breaking even (no CF). I do not like to rely on appreciation (lesson from previous crash). Is there something that I'm missing here?  
4. Can I do BRRRR using a loan? I know banks do not loan unless it's move-in ready. Or am I looking at the wrong venue? Even if I could get a loan, should I try this path?  
5. Following up on #4, should I flip houses? I have a day job. But I can visit the site during my breaks and after work. I also have a few friends who are contractors who do this for a living. But I'm scared as I have never done this before, but at the same time, if I plan to be a REI, this will come up soon, and I have to start somewhere. But I'm also aware that this might not be the right time, yet.  

I have so many questions in my head, but they might just be dumb questions or mostly fears. So that's it for now.  


**TL;DR:**  
Newbie, needs guidance. Not afraid to fail, but hoping the first purchase is not it. Want to start building a portfolio. Have questions about target purchase (see above).

6291,realestateinvesting,BUY/R/R/R/R vs. BUILD,"Backround: I’m a Naval Officer on my last year in the Navy. I plan on having $170K when I get out after the sale of a condo that cash-flows insufficiently and is located in a different state than the one I plan to call home.

I plan on using the buy, rehab, refinance for cash out, rent, repeat method. I understand its benefits for longterm hold rentals. BUT my question is, taking into account the following things, does it make sense to also potentially purchase land and build my own fourplexes (using the same plans and crew over and over to save costs)? 

One important consideration: VA loans are unlikely to be able to be used for the B/R/R/R/R method considering homes need to be move-in ready, so I am considering an alternative use for my VA loan (outside of just finding a really fantastic deal like a shortsale, foreclosure, or other, which I will definitely be on the lookout for.) 

That being said, I understand custom builds are generally more expensive than buying an existing structure. But can I do it by:
Using a VA Construction Loan (max units allowed 4). I have to put zero down. BEFORE shopping for land, have a list of contractors lined up that can work with me for the foreseeable future. I designed a two story complex with all the plumbing on the center wall, two units on bottom, two units on top. SO, I can put ZERO down on a brand new apartment complex, maybe even with land included (this could hurt cash flow I know, but on the refinance I can adjust how much I finance for to yield cash flow potentially, comment if this is unlikely to be possible). I plan on making and installing my own hard wood floors for probably $20K savings in all four units (which I will have made before my purchase). I will also purchase my doors and windows in advance for MAX discount MAX quality possible, and then have the architects plans reflect the sizes of those doors and windows (essentially design house around them, note my cousin is an architect). Roof will be tin. Plan is to shou sugi ban the exterior myself before the contractors install the side panelling (burn the outside of the wood to prevent pests and rot) then seal it either black or a nice color. This will likely save money on buying ready made siding. Exterior will be a cool Blackish color with a red tin roof. The flooring will be repurposed wood shou sugi ban (which has a fantastic effect), ash brushed off, then sealed. I should be able to get the wood for free. I will just have to pay for the tools, which I can use for all future projects.
Plan is to have all lighting fixture locations installed so that I can shou sugi ban some wooden blocks, stain them and create mason jar lighting. Essentially design the fixtures so I can install very cool, very modern, very cheap lighting.

I plan on installing all flooring, perhaps counters, lighting fixtures, and likely roof myself. Plan is to use a tin roof for easy installation, longevity, and greatly reduced future maintenance costs.
Now. That being said. I will have put Zero down. THE HOPE is that with all of the modern but extremely cheap methods I employed in designing the house that it will appraise for a decent amount more than I actually end up paying for it. I can either refinance and keep all the equity in it OR (more likely refinance enough to take out anything I spent on the design features but leave the rest in). If refinance doesn’t yield money back I will have spent about $50-$60K on the place myself, but it will be new, young, hip, and well maintained, so hopefully can still cash flow upwards $500 pure cashflow post maintenance a month (at least).

If I can refinance conventional/25% investment loan then I can rinse repeat with a new piece of land and the VA construction loan.
SO, does this make any sense? Is it possible to save enough money on a new build by doing many things myself? I figure using the same crew to build the same exact complex will streamline the process and save money on later builds (as well as give me experience and raise my own work efficiency).

TL;DR Are there ever instances where building a fourplex can be cheaper than buying with hard money loans, rehabbing, renting, and refinancing? If so, please provide examples. I have the option of using a VA loan for either the Build or Refinance (will live in if do so)."

For now my biggest goal is to retire as early as possible im thinking 35 years old max!
So im thinking about buying 3 properties free and clear and that should make me financially free with around 55/60k a year cash flow .
Ive spoken to a buyers agent and he recommends that I should get property on interest only and build up my profilo , problem with that is I think if I do that it would take me way longer to retire and get the income that I want .
My plan is pretty simple its to buy 3 propertys in the 290-320k mark and pay them all off free and clear in around 10-12 years  
So in that 10-12 years do use think I should do my plan and how should I approach it ? Or would his plan get me what I wanr faster and make me weather ? His plan pretty much is get as many propertys as possible and when equity builds up buy more property etc  which isn't a bad plan it would build me alot of properties but then I think it would take me yearsssssss to pay them off and I might be stuck to my job for way longer then planed.
Soo yeah id love to hear your thoughts/ and yeah im a novice investor atm lol
Feel free to tell me how use think I should invest my money /what method to use etc but keep in mind I wanna retire asap and ill be happy with cash fliw of 1000 dollers a week for now .

6297,realestateinvesting,The Flipping Formula,"Hey everyone, my first time here. I took a 3 day ""Real Estate Investment Accelerator"" workshop (2000 USD$). It was created by the Flipping Boston TV show host Dave Seymour. He was present at the free seminar and a skype call during the last day at the work shop. Seemed like a genuine guy, he gave out his personal phone number to any one who went to the advance training (50 000 dollars!) I couldn't find much info about this on reddit so i thought i'd give back for all the things I've taken from the internet. I'd like the share the formula they used to help price real estate investments. There's no way I can write everything that happened/was said but ill try to say what I got out of the event. This is the basic formula on finding out your MAO (Maximum Allowable Offer)

ARV (After Repair Value of the property)

-Subtract Repair Cost (A Contractor will give you a bid but you will need to guess before they accept the offer. They didn't talk much about this)

-Subtract Purchase Costs (1%) (Lawyer/Attorney Fees)

-Subtract Holding Costs (3%)(Utilities/maintenance fees during the flip)

-Subtract Sales Costs (3%) (Closing Costs)

-Subtract MINIMUM PROFIT (20%)

-Subtract ""Fudge Factor"" (3%-5%)(For unexpected costs/repairs)

This will equal what you should offer the owner of the house.

MAO = ARV - repair cost - 31%

Here's and example

ARV = 140 000

Repair cost = 20 000

Purchase cost 1% = 1400

Holding 3% = 4200

Sales Cost 3% = 4200

Profit 20% = 28 000

Fudge factor 4% = 5600

MAO = 140 000 - 76 600 

MAO = $76 600

This means if you plan on renovating and flipping for a profit you should only offer $76 600. These are the same numbers that i used for my very first property except i didn't know the formula at the time and I paid $100 000 for the house so i missed out on 23 400 in profit, does not include my labor or holding costs either. LESSON LEARNED!

Another formula they used was

PMCF (Positive Monthly Cash Flow) x 12 (months in the year) / initial investment = Cash on Cash return

For my rental i make about 600 positive cash flow

(600 x 12) / 40 000 (20 000 repairs, 20 000 mortgage down payment) = 18% yearly return on my money invested, not to bad. This does not include the costs like replacing a roof, vacancy, tenant damage etc which are bound to happen with rentals

They talked about making a Power Team which consists of

A Mentor (someone already a real estate investor)

Real Estate Agent experienced with flipping

CPA - An accountant that knows finances well and your goals

Mortgage Brokers - Help with finances and lease options as investments

Real Estate Attorney 

Property Management Company

Bankers &amp; Community Bankers

Their Software (pretty sure its just www.propertyfarm.com)

Cash Buyers - You want a list of people already flipping/real estate investors so if you find a deal that you don't want to do you can still put it under an ""Assignment of Contract Offer"" on the property (if they accept any ways) and bring it to them to take over and you get a finders fee, they said 2000$-5000$ depending on the deal.

Contractors - You want four licensed and insured contractors preferably with experience flipping houses. They each will make a bid on the repair costs and you use that to negotiate further.

My question is how do I think about the economies of scale strictly on the maintenance level. I would assume for example that a 4 unit location vs an 8 unit location is less economic on a maintenance perspective as certain costs like the roof, painting, boiler replacement etc are generally all the same so effectively the maintenance level ""per unit"" is higher in the smaller 4 unit location than say the 8 unit...does that hold as you go larger as well as long as it is under one roof? i.e. does an 8 unit 2 story location most likely have higher maintenance costs per unit than say a 4 story 23 unit location all under one roof ..same question in reverse for a 4 unit vs an 8 unit...

I am charging $1670/mo and my mortgage+PMI+insurance+tax is now $1313/mo, last year it was only $1212/mo, so you can see how this affects my profitability.

ps. There is no way to get rid of the PMI without a re-finance, which I'm not willing to do.

6311,realestateinvesting,"Better option than buying a ""Fix-and-Flip""",[removed]
6312,realestateinvesting,it's time. $300k and lots of time.,"Last March I bought a 1600sq ft 3/2.5 townhome in Midtown, Houston. I paid $300k cash and the house has already appreciated about $14K since. I I rent out a room (no mortgage) and everything works out pretty great, minus having all my resources tied up in a singe house. I'm exploring the option of doing a cash out refi and setting up some perpetual cash flow with some sort of rental property or development venture of some kind. Possibly even a balanced portfolio with index funds etc.  There's a property in a high demand area that I could purchase outright and build a 10-plex on with parking. Could very conservatively charge $1k rent on a 1000sq ft brand new well furnished spot less than a mile from downtown and cover it. The lot would be purchased outright and the building might cost me $125k. It's .3 miles from downtown and in one of those infamous ""up and coming areas"". I jog around the neighborhood every morning with my dog - at least 50 townhouses have gone up in three's or sixes, sometimes 10-home communities. My thinking is, why don't I buy a 15k sq ft unimproved lot and build ten 1,000sq ft micro units on it?

I'm just ballparking here, am I on the right track?

can anyone think of a better way to pull out 300k stuck earning ~4% mortgage interests and make it earn a health(ier) return? "
6313,realestateinvesting,Questions about military and real estate investing,"I am looking to buy an investment property, however also am expecting military deployments in the future.  I can get a great mortgage rate and have an opportunity on an off the market house for a very good price.  The deployments will require me to get a property manager and I am needing to know what to look for or tips in finding the right one.  Or if I should just avoid the property all together because of my situation.  

Many Thanks!  "

6318,realestateinvesting,Multifamily Real Estate,"Multifamily Real Estate can be a tremendously lucrative investment vehicle, and can provide for a solid stream of regular income, large property valuation increases, and stellar tax benefits.

An important thing to know is that apartment complexes are heavily valued based on their operations.  The Net Operating Income (NOI) of a property has more to do with the sale price than the physical state of the property itself (not to say that it has no influence, mind you).  To find the value of a particular property, you need a couple of pieces of information.  You need the NOI ( = Total Income – Total Expenses), and you need the cap rate.  A cap rate is something of an arbitrary number, it’s the ratio of NOI to the value of the asset.  Cap rates are typically determined by property location, quality of the asset, and how new the asset is.  You can often estimate a property cap rate by looking at that particular market and its trends.  The location of a property can heavily influence this number, and newer/nicer properties typically have lower cap rates. 

Nicer properties with low cap rates typically return less, but are considered a safer investment, since it is less likely for certain systems to fail, or expensive problems to arise.  Older properties are riskier and require more upkeep, but typically have a higher return on investment.  These older properties (B and C class) also enjoy lower competition, as developers don’t build new complexes in these categories.  Almost all new build apartments are competing against nicer, A-class properties.

The management of these properties is about finding the right staff, and the right rhythm of operations.  The more highly occupied an asset is, the more income it will generate.  This must be complemented by keeping expenses in check.  A lot of expenses run through an apartment property every month, such as Real Estate Taxes, Insurance, Payroll, Maintenance Expenses, Marketing Expenses, and more.  Having a team in place that can both lease apartments and maintain the property while keeping expenses low is key to realizing a high return.  Items like the RE tax escrow are fixed, and out of the control of the property management team—however, the staff does control certain areas of expenditure like supplies, contract work, etc.   

Taxes serve as a significant incentive for real estate investors.  For example, an investor can be entitled to quarterly distributions from the property, and these distributions are essentially tax free.  This is because of the way the government looks at the asset, and its relation to the investor.  If an investor owns 10% of the asset, he also owns 10% of the debt, 10% of the depreciation, as well as 10% of the income.  These factors play a role in how the government decides to tax you when receiving a distribution.  In most cases, you will pay either nothing or a negligible amount in taxes on distributions.  Additionally, if the property were to appreciate in value, ownership could elect to refinance the loan, allowing for the property to recapture some of that appreciated equity.  This can be a source of very large cash-out distributions to investors, which are also essentially tax free based on the above concept. Imagine buying a property for $10 million.  4 years later, if the property has been performing well, it could potentially be worth $14 million.  Refinancing allows for you to basically restructure the loan to cover that additional $4 million in value.  To put it basically, investors will get a big check for their percentage of the value increase.  

The only time an investor is liable for tax in the income from the property is when ownership decides to sell the asset.  Investors will be responsible for capital gains at the time of the sale—*Unless*—the investor decides to roll over their sale proceeds into a new investment property.  This is possible through what is called a 1031 exchange, and it allows investors to avoid paying capital gains taxes if they find a new Real Estate Investment opportunity to dump the cash into within a certain window of time.  An investor could potentially invest $100K in a property, pull tax-free distributions out for the lifetime of the investment, and then roll their sale proceeds into a new investment (rinse, repeat), essentially deferring taxes until they die, all the while generating income on that initial $100K.

6320,realestateinvesting,Finding rental properties,"Hey all!

I'm new here, and I was wondering how you typically find rental properties (1-4 units) to invest in. Zillow and Trulia don't seem to have a specific filter for rental properties, and you can't filter by rental yield. Biggerpockets has a marketplace, but it seems like the filtering options are very limited, and I have to manually look up whether or not the neighborhood the property is in is good. I essentially have to go through the listings one by one. LoopNet is mostly for commercial properties that are out of my price range. Roofstock is pretty close to what I'm looking for, but it's only available in Florida, and the deals on there aren't great. There are individual turnkey providers for rental properties, but what I find is that most of the properties listed are in working/lower middle class neighborhoods, and selection is usually limited. 

Is there some sort of Zillow/Trulia type site where I can just do a search of all rental property listings and filter by area, neighborhood grade (including crime rate, school quality, job growth, population growth, vacancy rate, median household income, etc.), school quality and yield? I'm looking for high yield investments properties in A grade neighborhoods with good local economies that can support housing prices."
6321,realestateinvesting,Thinking of trying my taxes myself.. questions about my rentals,"Hello,

I have a number of long-term and short-term vacation rentals in my home state and a neighboring state.   This is not my full-time job, most of my income is still from my W2... and due to time constraints, I've been using a CPA over the last few years to do my federal and state taxes.


I am now considering trying to again do my taxes myself using some of the well known commercial programs... but I'm not sure what information I need to know in order to properly account for various aspects of my real estate investments...   I imagine things like depreciation and capital expenses, etc.., but I don't have a full grasp on what I need to track and what information I need to make sure I have from my accountant before trying this on my own.

Any advice or pointers to sites with good information?   Should all of this information be able to be pulled from historic tax returns?


Thanks!"

6327,realestateinvesting,little worried about property i'm closing on tomorrow. need advice,"my fiancee and I just bought an investment property in the port richmond section of Phladelphia. Its not the best area right now, but is likely to appreciate and I found what I thought was a pretty decent property. 75k duplex, 625 rent from each side so 1250 a month. th mortgage is going to be 400 a month so after accounting for vacancy and maintenance we should be cash flowing 650-700 a month.

Closing is tomorrow. The inspection and appraisal went fine. What were worried about - We had trouble getting the first floor tenant to answer the door twice so far- once when we initially came to look at the house before we even put an offer in, and tonight when we went over to do the final walkthrough. Tonight we also learned that the first floor tenant just switched phones and the landlord didnt have his number. Basically we saw the second floor, which was 100 percent fine, but didn't see the first floor. Should we be worried about this? It was fine during the inspection, and the tenant was very accommodating and seemed like a decent guy according to the inspector.

One other thing- I have a copy of the leases but no proof that the tenants have been paying rent. I have no worries about the second floor tenant, but was a little worried about the first. Apparently its pretty common not to see proof of payments with duplexes. I'm just looking for any advice/opinions from you guys."
6328,realestateinvesting,"What to do with my equity? Sell,Rent,ReFi,Invest?","Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

I bought a house about 18 months ago for 168K at 4.25%(30year loan), my mortage is about 1k(insurance, mortgage insurance, interest, taxes, etc) and I currently owe about 158K. I was thinking about refinancing my home for the current rate at 3.65%, the local bank would also not charge me any mortgage insurance, which is about 200 off my mortgage. 

I recently spent 9k to turn the garage into a studio and also built a shed(144sqft). My home sits on a flat acre. If I refinance it should appraise around 175k-190k, should I pull the equity and invest it into another property or just refinance for what I owe and enjoy the low payment?

If I were to invest in another property it would be around 130K that will need around 20k worth of work and it should sell in the 180k range, or I could rent it. I have lived in my town for over 15 years and now the area pretty well.

I was also thinking about buying a nicer home to move my family into and rent out our current place.
My last option that I was thinking about was to refinance for what I owe, pull the equity and remodel the kitchen and redo the floors.

My options in summary:

1.Stay put

2.Refi for what I owe

3.Refi for what I owe, pull the equity to remodel my home

4.Refi for what I owe, pull the equity to invest in another property

5.Refi for what I owe, pull the equity, purchase another home and rent out our current home

This my first real estate property and I am not sure if any of my options a good. Due to my age not many of my friends own homes  so they don't really have a helpful insight on my situation. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated and if you have a better option that I haven't thought off please dont hesitate to share!

6329,realestateinvesting,"Looking for advice on first rental property purchase... 2 unit, 160k, 1900 rent","​I've wanted to get into real estate investing for a while now and I'm finally at a point life-wise (settled in an area with a job I like) that I can start making deals.
My goal with real estate is to pick up 5-10 properties in the next 5-10 years that are solid, cash-flowing rentals.
My real estate agent who is also a friend and investor brought us a property that she is listing for friends of hers. The basic story is that these people aren't good landlords and don't want to do it anymore because they had a tenant that didn't pay the bills. Our agent doesn't want to buy it because she just closed on 2 properties and is tapped out for the moment.
Property Details:
2 unit, upper (2nd/3rd floor) and lower (1st floor/finished basement)
List Price: 175k
Agent's suggested offer: 160k
Owner pays:
Taxes: 2600 yearly
Insurance: 800 yearly
Oil heat: 1200 (last year with low oil prices) yearly
Water/Sewage: 1400 yearly
Trash: 400 yearly
Mortgage @ 160k with 20% down: 611/month


1st Unit: Rents for $950. Large 1 bedroom with finished basement, sunroom, large living room and kitchen, hardwood floors, washer dryer in unit, lots of closet space and storage. Comes with tenants who have been there 2 years and pay on time.
2nd Unit: Previously rented for $950. 2-3 bedroom unit, but with unconventional layout. The first floor has a large eat in kitchen (decent shape with pantry), nice-sized bathroom in decent shape, washer/dryer off the main hallway, and then two large rooms with closets. The 3rd level has 2 medium sized rooms with sloping ceilings that could be used together as a 3rd level suite or as 2 separate bedrooms.  Currently vacant.


Cap rate: If I include a 5% vacancy rate and 2000/yr maintenance allowance, the cap rate is ~8%.

ROI: With vacancy/maintenance, ROI on my 32k down payment is about 13%.


Other details: The property is in a nice looking, quiet neighborhood and is in overall good condition with new windows. The location is close to major highways, university, hospital, etc. Also, it is in one of the top school districts in the area. It is a twin house and the neighbor is an older woman so there is the potential to buy the other half in the future. My fiancee is from the area and knows it well...we also have many local connections.
Work needed: The top unit needs new flooring and paint. Also, I don't know if it makes sense to invest in moving a wall to give the unit a more traditional living space (not sure if possible and how expensive). Also, I'd eventually like to get gas heat and have it split between the 2 units which I estimate would cost 10k. 


Hesitations: We are investing in my fiancee's hometown and the real estate agent is an old high school friend. I generally trust her judgement but I know she is friend's with the sellers and has multiple competing interests to balance. Also, I've always wanted to rent units that I understand and would rent myself...which makes me concerned about the unconventional layout of the top unit.


I know this is a lot but I'm looking for some feedback to help get me over the hump on my first deal. Thanks for any input.

6330,realestateinvesting,"First rental, nervous!","Im looking at a duplex in NC that costs 150k. Since I live in NY, I'm using a rental management company (homeunion.com). The rental company estimates i'll be making $700 in rent for each floor.

I'll be putting 50k down, leaving me with a 100k mortgage. Assuming my mortgage is around $600 a month, HOA/taxes another $300- i'm left with $800 profit. Is this right? Am I forgetting something vital?

This seems to be a good deal to me, but I guess I'm unsure of myself. If there are any holes in my logic, please enlighten me, I'm here to learn. 

EDIT: The duplex is also in Durham, specifically. I'm a little concerned that it's not in the best area (according to Trulia)- not a lot of crime by any means, but definitely not the best. Is this something to be particularly concerned about, since the rental management company will be handling the vetting of renters? 

Edit: Yeah, I meant $500, typo sorry."

6333,realestateinvesting,Predatory Lending... what should I do about it?,"So my husband and I found an amazing home that needs to be rehabbed. Totally unlivable, needs new foundation etc. We love it. It's in a great area we want to invest in. However, they will not accept a 203k, then the listing agent says- but I will privately fund the loan for you. WTF?! The house is bank owned. The only thing I can think of is that the bank has to sell the house for over 150 to make back their money... and because the house won't appraise at that, they can't go through FHA. However, how can a bank (of all places) sell a house for more than it is worth (in another banks eyes?) Additionally, my agent is being dodged by everyone trying to find out who holds the title to the house and get a straight answer as to why they will not accept a 203k. They keep saying, ""I will have to call you back.""

I love this house and neighborhood and would pay the appraisal value and go through the 203k. The house has been on the market for 2 years- maybe more. It was foreclosed, went auction, didn't sell, was listed for sale, the listing expired (or something like that)... I am basically chasing these people down to sell me the house. 

I have called the real estate commission in my state to file a complaint. What else can I do? The broker won't even call my agent back.... but mostly I am furious that the listing agent said he would finance the private loan. Am I wrong to feel this way? 

Thank you in advance. "
6334,realestateinvesting,Is this crazy?,"I live in San Diego. The cost of living here is insanely high, but I love it and I'm here to stay. I'm trying to begin to create a long term financial plan, and I'm wondering if investing in real estate is the way to go to build my wealth. I have a Masters in Architecture, so this may involve a bit of home updating/flipping as well.
  
My idea is to buy a home where my parents live (they are retired) in a suburb outside of Tampa, Florida. I could afford a down payment for a home there in just a few years, because the residences there are less than *HALF* the cost of a San Diego home. I'd only do this if I were able to find a home that I can rent for the mortgage payment + positive cash flow. I'd have emergency savings that would allow me to pay the mortgage payment for the months that I can't find tenants.
 
My mom has a rental property in FL currently, and I may use her as my ""property manager"" since she has experience. I'd pay her a fair wage, and could easily switch to someone not in my family to do this job if need be. My father is also very handy, and could do many of the minor fixes/repairs that might be needed when renting. My Aunt lives down the street from them, and she is a real estate agent. I know it's not super recommended to rely on family, but I feel like the stars have aligned. At the very least, they could help guide me.
  
I would buy the property, and have the tenants pay the mortgage, while hopefully collecting a bit of excess cash flow. Over time, I may update the property, and increase the rent value to reflect the changes. During this time, I would continue to rent in San Diego. When the market is on an upswing, several years down the line (or whenever), I would attempt to sell for profit. If for whatever reason I needed to visit the property, I can visit/stay with my parents for free.
  
Is this a crazy idea? Or might it actually work? As an architect, my salary will never be quite high enough for me to easily afford San Diego real estate on my own. Would this be a good way to build wealth? Any advice is much appreciated!"

6340,realestateinvesting,What is your minimum cash on cash ROI for an investment property in a slow appreciating area?,"I've been diving into the possibility of purchasing a SFH or a multi-family investment property, and I want to keep my cash on cash ROI as high as possible.

The property appreciation in the areas I am looking are pretty low (basically matching inflation), so these would not be units I would necessarily flip within 3-5 years. But the appreciation is at least steady, so I am keen on purchasing and holding for 10-20 years if possible.

That being said, there is a huge difference in how much cash on cash ROI can be made for SFH versus multi family fourplexes in the areas I am looking, so I am arbitrarily trying to match my SFH returns with the fourplexes in my analysis. Therefore, I am trying to get **at least** a 5% cash on cash ROI and a ~10% true ROI with principal reduction, which is doable.

**tl;dr I am trying to get at least a 5% cash on cash ROI from my investment property. Is that too low or too high of a benchmark if the property is only appreciating at the pace of inflation?**"

6348,realestateinvesting,"Pooling together music/arts organizations to collectively purchase a space in Saint Paul, MN","I’m on the board of a small new music organization, based in Minneapolis/Saint Paul Minnesota, fiscally sponsored by Springboard for the Arts, a nonprofit organization.  We are considering teaming up with other groups and collectively buying a historic church that is currently on the market.  It has the best acoustics in the twin cities.  We and the other groups would use it for our own music events (mostly serving a nonprofit purpose), but would also be able to rent it out to other groups.  We will mostly be dependent on being awarded grants and getting support from foundations to be able to afford to do this.  We have had a lot of success in the past getting funding, though this acquisition would by far be our biggest project to date.    

Firstly, I’m looking for advice on how partial ownership would work.  How does one pull together a group to go in for that kind of thing?  How hard would it be for a group to ever sell their partial ownership?  And if one of the groups does sell, how can we insure that they will not sell to some one whose goals for the space conflict with our own?  

Secondly, any advice on loans for nonprofits would be helpful.  I know there are some organizations that specialize in this.  Would we need our own nonprofit status to get most of those loans, rather than relying on being fiscally sponsored by a group that already has nonprofit status like we are now?  

Also, I am not sure how royalties would work.  We usually get paid at least some money through ASCAP when music composed by one of our members is performed.  I don’t know if that would still happen in a space we own.  Plus, since works composed by people other than ourselves would sometimes get performed there, we would probably need to pay ASCAP.  I’m not sure how much that would cost us.  

Finally, another thing we considered to save costs was having some members of the group live on site, either paying rent, or personally becoming partial owners with their own money.  But, I’m concerned that because it’s zoned as commercial, it would either be illegal to live there, or would require a mixed-use permit.  I’m also concerned about the safety regulations being less strict than a conventional home.  And of course, if one of us does personally become a partial owner with the intent to live there, would they qualify to pay property tax at the rate a homeowner would normally get for their primary residence, or would they have to pay a higher rate?  

Aside from these things, I’m sure there are a lot of other potential problems I haven’t even considered.  Thanks for any advice.

At first I had the idea of investing into a Multi-Family home for first time buyers.         
        
But I met somebody recently that say thats a bad idea, because you have to live there with the tenants, and if they find out you the land lord they will nag you constantly for every little thing, and you have to worry about them not paying. He suggested I buy low and sell high instead, and gain assistance from rehap programs to fix up the properties.           
         
But I want to know what you all think is the better option? Also if we look at the second option, I am curious how do investors go about doing this? Do you move out then sell?

6371,realestateinvesting,Want to begin Real Estate investing... what should take priority?,"Hi everyone,

As I am getting older, I want to pursue investing in real estate vs the stock market. I have dabbled a bit in the stock market but it just doesn't seem like it's for me. My father and my grandmother both are real estate investors and have/own multiple properties, so the whole business is not a new subject for me. My FT job is Accounting for an insurance company, but I also make a bit of cash on the side doing the bookkeeping for my families' properties. I also use to tend to the properties for my family as a kid. I would cut the grass, collect the rent, plow the driveways etc to pay for my car insurance growing up. The duties of a landlord I'm aware of.

I'd like to get into real estate myself now. Currently 25 years old and I have some questions prior to really digging into the investing side and plan of action. 

I currently rent a townhome with my girlfriend, which I HATE throwing away about $18k a year in rent and currently owe about 62k in student loans so my questions are:

1. Should my first investment be paying off my high interest rate student loans?
1. Should I buy my own home first before investing in real estate to rent out?
1. Jump right into real estate investing
1. I have about 10k cash in my savings right now in order to do either #1, #2, or #3.

TL;DR - Pay off student loans and buy own home first, or jump right into investing."
6372,realestateinvesting,Real Estate Investing * How to get started *,"Question: How to get started investing in real estate intelligently??

If real estate has been about leverage, the question is does it make sense and what is the additional return above the S&amp;P500.

So an investment property requires at least 25-35% down payment. Anything over 4 families is considered commercial, which very few banks will lend on and with unattractive terms (or so I hear). Mixed use buildings are even harder to finance.

How does someone start investing in real estate when there is such a high requirement for money down? 

Basically, to invest in a building that costs $1 million, the purchaser must have at least $500k cash in savings to commit to this investment (down payment, repairs, vacancy, legal costs, etc).

Is there another way to be thinking about this?"

I have been a RE broker for close to 10 years and have been studying the market and waiting for my opportunity to get in, so I'm far from inexperiences in RE, but the idea of managing money and making it go as far as possible is totally new.

I'm looking for ideas and advice on the best way to make about 150k last for as many 100-120k SF rentals as possible and I'd like to start buying immediately because rates are so low.  My current idea is to negotiate with cash because it makes a big difference in my area right now, do the rehab and then re-appraise and mortgage the property closer to the after rehab value to hopefully get the majority of the cash out while still leaving a little room to cover expenses, but the real goal is to season the mortgage and get in while rates are low. 

Any questions/ideas/concerns are welcomed, I'm looking for advice or a sounding board to make sure I've thought of the angles I need to be aware of.

House A costs me about $200/mo and House B makes me about $500/mo.  I would like to refinance House B and cash out some to enable a refinance of House A to a traditional mortgage (freeing up the VA loan for future use).  This would also balance my income between the properties.

6418,realestateinvesting,Too Soon to expand? I would like to leverage equity to purchase second investment property. (X-POST /r/landlord),"Hello all. I am new to this sub and found it through posting this same question in another. It looks like I stumbled into the right place, but please correct me if I am wrong.

Here is my situation: I bought a rental property last May that has 3 units. I got a really good deal from the guy I manage properties for, and bought it under the FMV. I also had to put 30% down for the mortgage and as of now my LTV is at 66%.

The same guy has approached me about selling another property that is next door to mine, and I am really interested as it is a superb location. This property is valued at the same amount as mine, but has 2 units. I suspect the mortgage payments on this new property to be the same as my current one. If this is the case, the rent from the 2 units would (roughly speaking) cover the mortgage, insurance, and property taxes. I have managed these units for some time, so I familiar with the structures, and they are in good shape.

I was not planning on buying another property so soon, as I was going to save enough cash to buy outright, or at least a large chunk of it. However, the location is just about as good as it gets in my town; in a sought after neighborhood next to a research university (mostly young professionals and graduate students). There has never been problems with vacancy. Properties do not turn over very often here.

One last thing that I will mention about my situation is, I am in one of the units on Property 1, and the rent from the other two units pays the mortgage, insurance, property tax, and is in fact, slightly cash positive. Over the last year I have been able to put roughly 10k in improvements into the property by paying cash, so if I were to go through with refinancing, and get the property re-appraised, I suspect the LTV will decrease to around 62%.

I was just asked if I was interested in buying the other day, so I am in the beginning phases of looking into the possibilities. A large part of me wants to go for it, provided I can secure another loan. I am not sure what a bank will say if I approach them with less than a year of a mortgage, and request another. I do have some cash set aside that was going to go into construction on my property this summer, but it is not anywhere near the 30% I would need for another investment property, which is why I am looking into leveraging my current equity.

If you have had experience with a similar situation and can lend some advice I would really appreciate it. Like I said I am at the beginning phases of my research into this, so if I am way off base or you can point me in another direction, please let me know. Is there anything else you would suggest I consider before going down this route? 

Thanks!

6434,realestateinvesting,I Sold A House: Relationship Stories,"***I'll be typing this out over the next day***

I recently (as in this past week) did something I almost never do. I sold one of my properties. Standing on its own merit, at least for investors, selling a home typically isn't a big deal. It is part of the business. What I'm looking to share with other investors is how I developed and used relationships to create multiple win/wins for all involved.

Too often I see both new and experienced investors focused on ""finding a deal"" or ""How can I get the capital to do this deal"". While these are obviously great aspects of investing to focus on or questions to ask it tends to overlook what I consider the most important aspect of real estate investing: Relationships. Developing and creating relationships should be a primary area of development if not the preeminent focus of your life as an investor. There is a reason why an incredibly high percentage of very successful people read books on and invest in personal development. It works.

The particular story I'm going to share began innocently enough. It involves the home I bought referenced in this post: (I have to find the link).

Let's begin by looking at the initial relationships at the beginning:

1) The Handyman: This was who found the lead for me.

A) His Motivation: He would receive a finders fee if I purchased the property plus earn additional incoming working on the property.

B) Why: I had developed enough credibility in our relationship for him to believe I'd pay and that I knew what I was doing.

2) The Seller: Motivated per the uncomfortable family situation referenced in the original story I linked to.

A) Her Motivation: She had rented a house to her own family who not only wasn't paying her $300 a month for a $1100 a month house but was destroying it.

B) Why: Third party credibility. My handyman told her I could solve her challenge and offer a fair price.

**Aside**
I cannot overstate the importance of third party credibility. When three parties are involved the party to be introduced or the party that isn't present is always the expert.

If you tell someone else how great you are how do they typically respond? If someone ELSE tells someone how great you are this is 3rd party credibility. Party A has transferred to Party B trust in you. This is an incredibly powerful concept to understand.

**Continued**
Fast forward a year and a half after I had purchased this property. The home is now valued at 110k and I owe 46k on it. I decide that I'd like to pull some capital out of the property for other adventures. I originally purchased this property owner financed with 5k down. Over the course of 18-months I'd paid the Seller on time, every time. I also developed a relationship (business relationship...settle down neckbeards...this isn't /r/gilf... apparently that is a real sub...NSFW...ooops) with her by checking in every few months and making certain she was ok.

One of the funny digs an old-timer I know took at real estate agents is they celebrate with the wrong person after a sale. The Buyers don't have any money...they just bought a house. The agent should be taking out the Seller! Understand the concept of controlling the money in your deals and you can create a constant stream of inexpensive, private money for the rest of your career.

A 110k house means I could have likely refinanced out at 75k and after closing costs put 30k in my pocket (tax free as it is a new loan). However I didn't want to encumber the home by that much. So what did I do? I went to the Seller. I sat down with her and her daughter and explained that I didn't want to sell the property but I was looking to raise capital to do a few more deals.

I shared the benefit to the Seller if she agreed to my proposal (create the win/win). I offered a 5k principal reduction at closing and I offered to split their current mortgage in half and move each half onto two different properties. I also offered to raise the interest rate on the mortgages to 6%. An increase in the amount the Seller would receive each month by about $60. By paying down 5k in principal I actually reduced the number of years left in payments by a year or so as well.

**Side Note**
In developing a relationship with the Seller I knew she did NOT want cash aka for me to sell the property and give her 46k. She is in her 60's and loves having the extra income each month.

The Seller decided she liked my offer, we signed an agreement and I scheduled a closing for the following week. The refi was 50k done with private money on a five year balloon. I took an interest only payment schedule which slightly increased my net income on the property. After closing costs and paying the original Seller her 5k I had about 42k in hand...tax free.

This was back in December so I was fairly and looking forward to a strong start of 2016 and also deleveraging a little bit of debt. However, out of the blue, someone offered to buy the home for a darn near retail price.

**More to come**

They are coming up with multiple excuses why they can't show it.  Someone is sick, they are too busy with the other house, etc.  Texts are responded to that they can't talk now, voice mails are not being answered.  

They are paid up, and even paid this last month after they gave notice.  Should I just leave well enough alone and wait 2 more weeks to take the house back?  Or do you all think there is something going on that I should demand to see the house?  It's just kind of strange they seem to be keeping a distance now.  

I really have no reason to believe they are doing anything to the house- I'm just bothered by not being able to get in and show it.  One of the renters works in a job where he can't have any legal issues, so maybe I'm over-reacting.

6464,realestateinvesting,Will virtual reality or any recent tech. advancements cause a housing bubble near cities?,"Here is my thought on VR. I've been getting into real estate just north of NYC (less than an hour by train). The average price of a single family home is reasonably between ~300-600k on the MLS. I work in IT, and I'm certain that many of the people I work with, given the chance to work remotely for the same pay would take it. Where I grew up I could afford quite the house and land for half a million dollars, but here you'll find a few acres without a home selling for hundreds of thousands. I'm curious if others believe that VR will impact careers such that companies pay remote workers instead of local workers. More specifically, if others think people will migrate away from cities to lower cost-to-live settings as VR becomes ubiquitous and companies no longer pay higher wages to reduce physical locality of workers. I'm interested to hear all ideas as to why this will/will-not ever happen, as well as time frames people expect. IF this is a non-issue, can you think of any likely event which will cause a housing bubble / renting bubble in the NYC area in the near future?

As an example against why VR wouldn't cause a bubble: I could see VR being clunky at first and much like early web cams. Even with the advent of webcams, we wouldn't expect the employee to always broadcast their cam. Could we really expect an employee to always wear the VR headset while working remotely? Would the experience of wearing a VR headset for a meeting be any closer to a face-to-face then meeting over a webcam? I think due to the slow nature in which corps move, they would be slow to adapt a VR workforce, so at least this type of change is probably 10-15 years + out.

Another tech I could see hurting rental prices or house prices is peer funding. I think the number of many unit rental builds (100+) will increase quickly as builders gain access to quick funds via sites like fundrise. This could lower rent prices making it harder for individuals to compete.

6465,realestateinvesting,What's important in Real Estate Investment tools?,"Hi everyone!  I'm a business school student trying to validate some ideas around online real estate investment tools.  You see, I think there are some features that are missing from tools out there, like more accurate/local focused applications and better integration with local renovators and contractors.  I'm trying to prove/disprove these theories for a marketing class.  I'm not selling anything or making any money off of this.

6480,realestateinvesting,Want to purchase first duplex or fourplex and looking for advice,"I'm currently in the market to make my first purchase of a home and I've decided to go with an owner-occupied investment property in order to offset a mortgage and hopefully get some financial freedom. 

I'm 30, have about 20k in savings for possible down payment if need be, and have a credit score of around 740. I figure that I would be comfortable with a loan of 300-325k as I'll probably get a great interest rate and could afford to pay the mortgage if I didn't have a renter.

My question is that I can't seem to find much guidance on which loan I should go for and whether I should deal with a mortgage broker or find a direct lender. Some of the properties I'm looking at are in a rural area of Austin and the realtor I've spoken with tells me I could qualify for a 0% down USDA loan. I love the idea of keeping all of my money in my pocket, but from what I've read, those types of loans don't apply to income properties (which if true makes me think this realtor doesn't know what he's talking about), especially if I'm looking to buy more in the future. The other option I've found is an FHA loan with 5% down. 

Any help is appreciated as I'm looking to make the plunge sooner rather than later, but I have no qualms about postponing my plunge if conditions aren't favorable."

In the past several years I have picked up some rehab properties, mortgaged them, rehabbed them and rented them out.  I am now thinking of trying my hand at flipping one, assuming the right deal presents itself.  

My question is regarding financing. If I plan on flipping it, is a standard mortgage the best way to go, or can you talk about some other options, like hard money loans, short term loans, or identifying potential cash investors. 

I'd like to hear how some of you who have done these deals have structured them.  "

6535,realestateinvesting,OPM,"I need to refi my own personal primary, and I'm thinking about borrowing for an investment. 

My own refi would be to drop from my existing 30 into a 15 with about the same PITI.   I don't see a reason to go 30 with it, the difference in PITI just isn't that much, but the total cost is much larger. 

I could then either pay cash for the investment and rehab, or I could finance the investment and cash the rehab.  I doubt they'll lend me the rehab costs (would they ? ) 

With a new unoccupied purchase I'm probably looking at a 4.0 rate, with 15k down to hit the equity thresholds.  Add a 30k rehab and now I'm out 45k plus closing.  It currently takes me a little over a year to save up that much although there's no telling what future earnings would ever be.  The investment- in the most optimistic scenario - would take over 4 years to return that cash outlay alone... longer if I went with a 15 year mortgage on it. 

Or course, I could do a cash out refi on my own house, get a stupid amount of cash and then pay for the investment flat out, never touching the cash I have right now.  The rate would be higher (one quote was 4%), the monthly PITI goes up significantly although to an amount I can still easily manage at today's earnings,  I'm now lumping investment risk with my own home, I'm getting close to LTV thresholds, my total debt cost goes up significantly and I have a note well into my 70's.   However, I get to hold on to that 45k cash out I could expect financing the investment separately.  I am, of course, free to aggressively pay down that note on any schedule I want. 

And then there's the part of me that says ignore math, pay off the primary and do any investments in cash and be a FREE MAN completely debt free honestly it would only save me about 1200 PI a month, and would be a pretty significant hit against my savings.  Plus with these rates I'd kind of feel like I'm missing an opportunity.  But fuck I'd be free as a bird, and saving even more cash each month than I am now.   My current savings rate would go up,  I could end up savings the majority of my income while reducing income requirements for the future. 

1st world problems I know ... it's a combination of personal finance, financial independence and real estate but I figure most investors have to juggle these balances on a regular basis.  WWYD ?   "

6561,realestateinvesting,Confusion around home depreciation tax after selling rental home...,"With depreciation, it seems as though when we go to sell the property we'll get hit with a huge tax bill and lose almost all of our gained equity. I may be missing something but that alone seems to make renting the property for a long period with intent to gain equity kind of pointless.

For example, I am renting a $200,000 home to a family now and making roughly $150 per month after the mortgage.  I planned to do this for 5 years then sell it, allowing the renter to pay down the mortgage.  I've been reading about the depreciation tax which I was told to be nearly 40% of the value difference between the sell price and the current depreciated value.  So if the home is depreciated down to $150,000 in 5 years and I sell it for $225,000 I have to pay 40% tax on that $75,000?  That would eat up all of the equity gained.  I know you can roll the amount with the 1031 tax code and avoid paying the taxes for a while by putting it into a new property but we don't plan to do that.

Please tell me the information I have is wrong..."

My situation is we are a young family living in Southern California.  Wife and I are 33 with 2 young daughters age 9 and 2.  I make 63k a year and wife stays at home.  We bought our house in 09 and are starting to out grow it.   We bought for 230k and should be able to sell for between 345k - 365k.  This should leave us with a little over 100k after selling fees.

I've been going back and forth in my head with the idea of purchasing an investment property with the cash and living in an apartment for a while until we are able to save enough cash again to buy a house to live in.  From what I've read so far, it seems I will need to have more cash in order to buy a multi-unit (which is my first choice).

So right now, I'm stuck in a position where I don't know if I should either ride it out in our small house, sell and buy an investment property (maybe all cash in another state) or just put the money towards a bigger home.

I like the idea of creating other income.  I can still advance in my career and eventually make maybe high 80k or low 90k.  I don't like the idea of being so dependent on an employer.  My father in law owns several residential and commercial properties.  I've been helping him out for the last 2 years and have become familiar with several aspects of managing property. 

I'd appreciate if anyone has started investing with a family.  Any insight on how someone in my situation could get started in real estate would be great."

My partner and I are in the process of closing a real estate investment in BC. There are a few more profitable deals we would like to pursue in BC; however, we do not have sufficient capital funds at the moment to close the deal. Would anyone currently residing in Vancouver be interested in discussion about these deals? We will be happy to present our findings, analysis, and calculations through coffee over the weekend! 

If that's not possible, but you're aware of other ways to attract JV partners, would you mind sharing with me these venues? 

Thank you! "

I'm looking at getting into real estate investing.  I don't have any properties at the moment but I am getting ready to take the plunge.  I'm looking for a buy and hold strategy.

However, I wanted to know how you guys research rental prices in your market.  Right now, I've been finding properties then cross referencing those areas with Zillow, Trulia, and Craigslist.

Is this a reliable method?  Is there an easier way?

Thanks again!"

6647,realestateinvesting,Relocating and looking for Help/Advice.,"A little background first. Me and my wife are moving from Iowa to Sarasota, FL.  This past year we sold our investment property after renting it for 2 years.  We essentially flipped it and did quite well. We've been working and saving towards this move for well over a year.  Between saving, our flip, and selling the house we lived in we have 100,000+ cash to keep our real estate investments rolling. We have a realtor we've been in contact with that has been sending us distressed properties in the area.  Ideally we will buy a property, live in it and flip it. Long term we would like to get back into rentals as well.  I'm just looking for any advice we can get as we are very new to this and only have one property under our belt.  Maybe anyone familiar with the Tampa area or Florida?  "

6729,realestateinvesting,"Should I focus on less expensive higher risk rentals, or expensive rentals with low risk ?","29 Y.O. and I have been investing for about 5 years now, focusing solely on purchasing rentals next to a very large (55,000+) university. That market is going through alot of change suddenly that is forcing investors away; mostly centered around said university flexing their power and imminent domaining property left and right, plus building thousands more dorms. 

I have started looking in the other major urban city in my state near their large university(40,000+), and for the most part like what I see in purchase price vs. income that can be earned there. However, this university and especially the surrounding area have a MUCH more ""ghetto"" feel and the corresponding crime/property damage to go along with it. I have spoken with multiple investors in that area and they are pretty split along what they have to say: yes, alot of the time the students (or their shitty thug friends) destroy their properties or vandalize them and they constantly are putting money in to keep them up, but also the cap rate is fantastic if you can deal with the headaches. 
Now that I have started looking in the new city which my best friend lives, he is interested in potentially investing together. Another part of the city is exploding, as they have just gentrified it and prices and demand are taking off. He only wants to invest there. So let me give you the two general scenarios of what our choices are, and I'd appreciate any feedback. 

- Purchase a rental next to Thug U, for approximately $90,000 and rent for about $1,250/month, netting around $700/month before maintenance. DP would be 25%, allowing us to buy many more of these quickly and continue increasing our portfolio unit numbers.

- Purchase a rental in the most desirable area in town for approximately $425,000 and rent for about $2,500/month, netting only around $2-300/month. The play here would be for the value equity in 10-15-20 years.

I've went over the numbers many times and they are pretty accurate, but I'm asking what you would rather have. Lower valued property with high risk of increased and unforeseen costs/damage that allows you a monthly profit to continue buying more properties. Or a high value property that is low risk in extra costs that will always be filled providing low month profit, however will likely triple in equity value by the end of a 20 year loan? "
6730,realestateinvesting,My one year plan,"Okay, so I just got out of college. Yes, I have debt (33k), I am paying on a car loan, paying a cell bill, but I'm also currently living at home and saving money. I put around $700 a month away in savings and with me cashing out my life insurance and starting a new plan, I will get around $2500 for that. So my plan is to go buy a double for around $75,000 and put down $13,000. I then will rent out the other side and pretend I'm making rent payments so I am doubling down on the mortgage. I want to avoid paying rent because it is a waste of money. How does this sound to everyone? Any words of wisdom would be helpful. Thanks"

If it were a condo it would sell for $100k easily. The property manager says you can't get bank financing to buy a co-op unit and this is what keeps the prices so low for the area.  Does anyone know of a bank who finances co-op units and how arduous is the underwriting?  Conversely, if I were to sell the unit using seller financing how do you attach a lien to a share of stock?  I've checked with my regular real estate attorney and my back-up guy. Being in the South, they have never even done a closing with a co-op, much less even tried to set up seller financing. "

-I have a colleague with 19 rentals.  He aims to get to 30.  and do some flipping.
-He also owns a construction company and can build, fix, reno houses from scratch.
-Plan is we do a trust agreement for 10 years
(with an exit clause).
-I will still own house, but sign over title to him (with an interest recorded on title).
-He will take care of all management, costs etc and pay me $1500 per month (i currently have it rented for $1195)
-He will borrow against the house in order to acquire more houses to rent and some to flip for profit
-After 10 years he pays off any mortgage taken out and gives me back house unencumbered with clear title in similar shape he received it in.
-This way my house and I are becoming the bank.  I can in a sense invest it but my risk is limited to only that house (and not my personal condo and assets on the line).
(and instead of me taking loan to acquire more or invest with him with more risk exposure for me)
-we've hammered out a trust agreement and its at lawyers.

Can anyone advise what they think of this scenario?
I know he is not a fraud, know his wife and kids.  Its a 10 year plan to help take us both to retirement.
We are both about making it a win-win.

Lawyer so far has said what if prices drop and there's mortgage on house.  and what constitutes same condition less tenant wear and tear.

Any thoughts appreciated!

6781,realestateinvesting,Buying a home with an in-law to rent out the main house (in Virginia),"Hi, I'm trying to start investing in real estate and I am a bare-bones beginner. I would appreciate your advice and if you played devil's advocate regarding my plan.

TL;DR: I want to begin investing in real estate but I want to do it smart so I don't screw up. I have a plan to buy a house with an in-law, but don't know if it is foolish or brilliant.

My background: Excellent credit (around 798) and an ok job $48K (I also get 18K/year in military medical retirement pay). I have some debt, but with low interest ($11K at 0.5% and $7K at 3.45%). I only have about $1.5K in savings besides my IRA/401K ($10K). I am single, 25y/o and a veteran. 

I am seriously considering using the VA home loan to purchase a house with $0 down. I've been previously ""pre-qualifed"" for a loan of $325K but haven't finished the process of loan approval because I haven't fully decided if I want to buy yet, and I don't want the ding on my credit. I'm looking in the $300K price range and specifically want houses with an in-law suite. I plan to rent out the main house and live in the in-law. 

I have been researching online and it seems like the legality of this according to zoning laws is iffy. I called the city zoning administration and was told attached in-laws are ok (had read elsewhere for different states that they were banned), but didn't get any information about if you're allowed to rent out the main house if you live in the in-law. It looks like the laws are unclear and I'm not sure if I'd be setting myself up for failure.

Furthermore, I'm not sure if I have the skills I need to be a landlord...I've obviously never done this before, and I don't want to set myself up for a bad situation where maybe I can't rent out the place or I'm stuck with a dud. I'm trying to educate myself by reading stuff on the internet (ex.Bigger Pockets, reddit, quora, etc.).

Do you think I'm ready to plunge into this or should I spend more time preparing? If I should prepare more, what do you think I should focus on doing? (I definitely want to increase my savings). I grew up in a lower income family where bills were always an issue, but I worked hard to get out of the cycle of poverty. I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that, instead I want to build on my strengths to establish a new legacy for my family. 

Thanks for your advice!"
6782,realestateinvesting,Quick question about rehab on a fix and flip.,"So I found a property that is worth the investment! But I have a quick question. My father has done previous fix and flips and he is guiding me on his one but I want to check his path of thinking with some other people.

Should I get a GC to come in and over see the project for me OR should I GC the project myself and just contract out the particular work myself? I think the second option will save me money on the GC and possibly on the work too. 

Does anyone here GC their own projects or do they hire a GC to do it all for them? 

I am using a hard money lender FYI so this way you have some idea of my money situation."

6794,realestateinvesting,Would like to discuss lower end single family home (SFH) rentals.,"I was wondering if anyone had any good insight on lower end SFH rentals.  I'm talking about the kind in any major city that might be on or a couple blocks away from M.L. King Blvd (bars on the windows, AC evaporator in a cage, etc).  Sometimes these are Section 8 homes.  Any thought on this route versus college student rentals?  I'm asking because generally lower income homes potentially, if done right, can produce better returns.  In almost every major city if you compare on Zillow estimated sale price VS estimate rent your best return is on lower income housing.  Questions: At what point do you see your line that you don't cross for lower income housing?  For those that have rented in low income areas, how often were people late / evicted?  Where on this continuum of risk V. reward is the risk or trouble associated just too high or is it not worth the effort?  I appreciate your input!"

Preferably something above 50k a year. I had planned on getting a degree in finance and landing some kind of job with that to begin my dreams of investing and building wealth. I decided finance because i believe it is a crucial skill set to have in the field of investing and i want to know all about money and how it works. I messed up a little and don't have the greatest GPA. I guess what I am asking is do i have the right idea? And what other tips and advice might you have? What kind of job should i be trying to get?

I already know a decent amount about real estate investing through working with my mom and the properties she/I manage. 

The thing is, I want to be able to set myself apart from other real estate professionals by providing a ""Investing in [My City] Guide"", but I'm not sure of which information I should include and which I should leave out. Right now it's formatted similarly to a Buyer's Guide, but tailored to investors. Here's the other information I was thinking of including:

1. How to pick an investment (50% rule, more detailed look at cashflow).

2. Financing options for investments, including city funded programs for refurbishing low-income housing.

3. Market trends broken down by zip code (property values, % owned/rented, schools, inventory).

2. Tying into the above, what kinds of investments can be made in the city, pros and cons of each. E.g. Student housing, single-family, re-development of older areas that are regaining popularity.  

Is there anything else that you, as an investor, would want to know before starting your investment property search? Is there anything that you think I should leave out? Thank you!"

1.) Send a letter 
2.) If no response is received within two weeks, knock on their door one afternoon.

I'm debating on directly contacting them. On one hand it is more personal than a letter and since it is an older generally more hesitant audience, it shows that I am not trying to scam them but genuinely would like to buy their fixer upper. On the other side, I can see how some would find this potentially invasive.

Does anyone have any past experience with contacting absentee owners directly? Thanks for any and all advice."

We did not collect any rents over that period of time. Would I be able to write off the 30k of repairs, or does that factor into the buy price because it was attached to the loan?

Thank you for your time!"

6857,realestateinvesting,Best way to dip my feet into real estate investing?,"My wife and I (mid 20's) have saved up a good 40k (no debt) so far and we have been wondering what the best way to invest it would be. I thought of buying property and renting it out. The trouble here is that I have no idea where to begin. I know it is an option because of some success I've seen in other threads, but to tell the truth, I'm in Grad school for sciences and I have no idea what I'd be doing/how to go about it or even making the first baby steps.

Growing up, my parents owned a second home that we have in a neighboring state that we've been renting out to college kids during the school year and families during the summer months. Because of this, I know what can go right, and more importantly, what can go wrong with home owning (calls in the wee hours of the night, renters from hell, squatters who take advantage of the system, busted pipes in the winter, having to buy a new water heater right away, etc...). I have a few questions...

How do people generate more and more money from buying homes and renting it out when they're not making incredible profit after taxes/mortgage payments? If they're netting only 1500 a month from a piece of property, how do they eventually get to the point of just collecting money from their investment properties? Do you keep buying and buying? (maybe a better way to ask it is how do you eventually make a comfortable living off of this and what is the process of growth?, both monetarily and property wise)
Another question- what are the main differences and pros and cons in buying apartments or condos to try and rent those out through airbnb or buying a home and renting that out?

TL;DR: I have 40k that I'd rather put into motion in real estate than letting it sit in my bank account. I have no idea where to begin, what the ins and outs are, what to know, what to look for or how to find it."

6868,realestateinvesting,What MLS Search Tools are you using? I'm frustrated with Redfin &amp; Realtor.com,"I've been using Redfin since it's inception years or so.  They've consistently had the best search tool.  However they are starting to stagnate and they don't service every market I work in. So I've been augmenting my research with realtor.com, but they've just done a web redesign and IMHO completely ruined their search functionality.

&amp;nbsp;

I start my research at the neighborhood level.  I like to look at an entire neighborhood at a glance and filter results by price as well as by type (single vs multifamily etc.) to get a sense of the shifts in demographics and value across the neighborhood.

So I need to be able to view current listings and recently sold results on a map (not at the same time), with and quickly filter by price and type. I also want to be able to hover/select a property from a sorted list and have it highlighted on the map.  This allows me to see where a specific property is while staying at the neighborhood level.  I don't want to have to click into a property to see exactly where it is on the map. 
I then want to be able to tab-open a specific property to view details without leaving the current neighborhood level map.

Once viewing a specific property, I want to be able to view current listings and recently sold results (not at the same time) on a map, and be able to zoom in and move the map around see where they are in relation to the subject property. Having the ability to control the time period for the recently sold results is also important.

&amp;nbsp;

Realtor.com used to have much of this functionality, but the UX was terrible in that you could not open results in new windows. So it was horrendously slow. 

Maybe I'm unique in how I approach a new market, but I'm consistently frustrated with the tools that are available today. What sites are you using?  What other tips/tricks do you have to quickly assess a neighborhood and analyze a potential property/find comps etc?

I have a few rental properties, but they all have been purchased in a very straightforward manner.  

I have been looking for a multifamily but I'm put off by the pricing. This is a red-hot market, but the multifamily properties come with a premium.  However, if you do the math, the pricing precludes an investor from attaining a positive cash flow.  I have tried to work with the owners,  but they aren't very interested in alternative (non vanilla sales).  

* In these cases, do investors really purchase with no cash flow?  
* Do investors just put in additional cash to attain cash flow? Net is still a reduction to ROI
* Am I missing something here?  It is likely that I just haven't thought through this.

6950,realestateinvesting,Need some advice on first investment,"An acquaintance reached out to me regarding a real estate investment in an apartment complex via a syndicate which sourced the property and will handle managing it. This would be my first time investing in something like this so just wanted to make sure the points are standard:

The property is a class C apartment complex with 181 units. The syndicate will be taking 30% of net profits -- is this standard? 

The syndicate is also originating a bridge loan for the property. Since the property is currently at less than 90% occupancy its not available for a standard loan (they are going after this property because they believe they can turn around the occupancy rate and gain a lot more value through this mechanism). So they will be making a standard 1% origination fee. 

They are planning to hold the property for 5 years at which point they will sell assuming certain exit conditions are met. The annualized projected dividend over the course of the 5 years is 11% to the investors, and if at any point it goes above 25% the syndicate will receive 50% of the amount above 25% instead of the normal 30%. 

The total loan will be around $9 million. The closing costs they are approximating comes out to $700K. I want to make sure this number seems standard as well. 

Because the NOI over the last 12 months has been a lot lower than what they are anticipating when they increase occupancy, the cap rate they are purchasing the unit at is ~5.7%. With their expected results for the next 12 months, they are calculating a cap rate of 8.7%.

would love to hear your guys' thoughts here and if I left any important information out please let me know!

6954,realestateinvesting,How to creatively acquire this piece of land?,"Hey investors and real estate gurus alike,

Originally posted in /r/realestate but was transferred here.

A friend's parents own property that is nice and large, corner house, and comparable market value in the neighbourhood is ~800K and I've seen it shoot a little higher. This is in Vancouver, BC. It's an old beaten house, great fixer upper to demolish and reconstruct and they're ready to sell and move to a better more luxurious home. Their asking price is ~600K at their bare minimum. Now question:

I think this is a pretty sweet deal. I want to purchase it but how do I do this with little down payment? I don't have ~60K down but clearly what I have is a good deal, no? Can I bring this over to an investor and have us work out a deal? Is it even worth it? How can I squeeze the most out of this? I was initially considering rebuilding on top of this fairly sized piece of land and renting it out(I don't recall off the top of my head the sqft) but realtor clients advised it may be expensive to do so. That's probably really the only way to make a profit, but to maintain a good yield can the property go more than 800K after extensive rehab? Or am I just seasick

Let me know if there are more details needed. Thanks"

6966,realestateinvesting,The Two Biggest Factors in Negotiating an Unbelievable Purchase Price," Success in real estate investment begins with buying undervalued property. You can’t win in REI if you over pay for investments.

Finding great deals on purchase price is really not that difficult if you know where to look and what to look for once you get there.

Imagine you go to a yard sale where the price of the items is set by how much credit card debt is associated with each item.  A broom purchased a few years ago could be $52.00.  A lawn mower $150.00.  You get the idea and you would never go to a sale like that.  You would laugh all the way back to the car.

You go to a yard sale to hunt for bargains and not just for good deals, but pennies on the dollar.

Usually, the yard sale holder is moving or they are cleaning out the house to make room for something else.  Whatever the reason, they are willing to almost give the stuff away. This is the same concept I have used for years when buying unwanted rural vacant land.

Here are two tips to negotiating a great deal for yourself:

-The first criteria is that the property must be debt free. 

Execute a well-organized direct mail campaign contacting property owners that fit your criteria. Daily, sellers contact us to purchase their property. Several times a week, property owners contact us with property that has associated mortgage or seller financing debt.  There is simply nothing we can do about purchasing that property.

-The seller really wants or needs to sell the property.

Like in the yard sale example, they need to have a great desire to sell.  Accumulated back taxes can be an advertisement to the world that the owner is no longer interested in owning the                     property.

These are some of the ways we find cheap property and negotiate an unbelievable purchase price."

Long time lurker, first time poster. So about 8 months ago I decided I wanted to get into real estate development. Short blurb about my background, I got my Masters in Public Admin with a concentration in urban planning with the goal of going into urban planning. I’m also 27.  Around the time I was getting ready to graduate I connected with a group of planner, architects, and community oriented small scale real estate developers. This group/ movement is basically a bunch of urban enthusiasts that want to improve their community and  realize that the traditional levers to positively affect change in a cities built environment are vastly underwhelming and take forever. They’ve all come to realize if you want to see your city become awesome and have awesome places in them, you should just build them yourself. So if there is an awesome little area of town thats just getting off the ground by there are all these small abandoned buildings holding it back and you keep saying to yourself “someone ought to build ____”, well maybe you are that person. In a very round about way, we’ve combined urban planning / community development and real estate investing into a social entrepreneurship model. 

Upon getting hooked up with this group and at the same time really getting turned onto the idea of being in business for myself (and finally finding a way to turn my passion into a viable business) because of reading various books (mainly rich dad poor dad) and seeing some of my other friends starting up their own businesses. Since then I’ve been consuming information about all aspects of real estate (new development, commercial, retail, residential rental, house flipping, etc.) from various sources (bigger pockets, books, podcasts, talking to other people, etc). Its something I want to pursue full steam. Ultimately I want to get into small to medium scale residential rental properties and smaller commercial retail rentals and maybe mixed use (both rehabbing older properties and new infill development/building).

I’ve decided that the first step too take would be house flipping for a few reasons. A little bit on my background, I have a decent sized trust fund thats over 100k but less than 180k, so capitol isn’t an issue. I’ve decided to start with flipping because I will most likely be moving to another state (for my wife’s job) in 18-20 months (doesn’t make much sense in way of buy and hold rental properties). Given my time line for moving its the highest return on investment in the shortest amount of time (I’m under no illusions that this is a get rich quick plan or an easy thing ). I plan to use the capitol I raise from flipping or two houses to get me started buy and hold properties when I settle in my next city. Also I think that given my goal of eventually getting into larger developments/ new infill development that house flipping will give me experience in a lot of the skills needed for that. My general plan is to obtain a property by the end of January 2016 and begin the rehab process.

So my dad has had some experience with real estate because back in the 90’s he had about 5 rental properties and he also rented his old restaurant building. At first my dad was very supportive of the idea (granted my original idea was to do buy and hold properties before I knew about my impending move). In the last three months my dad has flip flopped on this issue easily five times, and seems to have fallen down on the side of flipping houses.

His reasons and arguments are as follows:
1) I don’t have a full time job to fall back onto (I’ve done a lot of temporary positions, paid internships, and some other side work writing) along with my partners income pay to the bills.
2) He thinks both the national and local (Tampa Bay) housing markets are very fickle and about to get more fickle. He thinks I missed the boat on flipping, which to some degree is true this is no longer 2010 where you could buy barely distressed houses a dime a dozen.
3). I have no experience with flipping or real estate.  There are a lot uknowns essentially. Especially construction/handy man stuff. He thinks that contractors will take me for all I’m worth.
4) The move. He thinks that impending move will get in the way…even though its 18 months off.

My dad general advice is almost exactly what poor dad’s, from Rich Dad Poor Dad’s, advice was: get a good job, get a 401k / retirement plan, get good benefits, and invest in bonds/cds/stocks/ and other safe instruments . My dad is big into investing money and putting it to work for you just very conservative bets. 

So I’m under no illusion that flipping houses is easy. I understand that its a risky endeavor, but to make money you’ve got to take risks. I think that I’ve got a decent understanding of the risks involved and the process. I still have more I need to wrap my head around, but I’ve got a good foundation and I’m seriously starting to take steps to make this happen. So , am I crazy and my dad right or is this a case where I should go it on my own?

I think the actual buyer is out of state.  It is a very standard contract template, no special provisions.  They submitted $1000 in earnest money.  


During the inspection period the buyer did a walkthrough and then requested a ""mutual release"" from the contract, citing ""too much rehab needed"" and ""didn't know it was a duplex.""  (It's not a duplex, it is a townhome..one half of a duplex separately deeded).  


The contract specifies that the buyer may respond to a written, independent inspection report, and that the report must identify a defect as defined by our state law.


Since there was no independent inspection (just a buyer walkthrough), and no report or written response, can I exert some pressure on the buyer to either go through with the real inspection, complete the purchase, or give up their earnest money?


I knew this was a risk, selling to a wholesaler, who would probably not go through with the purchase in the end, but I believe they should be responsible for the hassle they put us through without doing their due diligence prior to signing a contract.

7044,realestateinvesting,"I know you ""Can't eat equity"", but is it foolish to invest in it?","I'm hoping someone can help me out with this concept. I'm sure it will become abundantly clear that I am a Newbie to real estate investing (don't own anything), but I am very interested in getting involved. Also, as a disclaimer- Please don't interpret this post as my unwillingness to do the work nesscary to get a great deal, I am just trying to be conservative and pragmatic in thinking considering this would be my first purchase.


First, a little about me. I'm 28 and through my career have roughly 2.5K in disposable income per month. I also live in an incredibly expensive area where I couldn't see REI working. 


In my mind you make money in REI by:
1- Monthly Cash Flow
2- Equity
3- Appreciation (Which honestly I have little faith in and for the sake of this post, let's consider it negligible to be conservative) 


I always hear the phrase ""you can't eat equity"" and I get it. One of the main drivers behind REI is to create monthly cash flow. In my eyes, setting yourself up in a position to create monthly cash flow takes a deep understanding of the market and likely managing the property yourself. Considering my situation mentioned above, I frankly am not interested in buying in my area and because of that will likely need to use a management company. That leaves me with equity as a way to make money (monthly cash flow would be great of course).


With all of that out of the way, does anyone here purchase for equity alone? I consider it a retirement fund. I see the situation as ""I put in an X down Payment and receive Y Dollars in return per month""...I just cant touch that money until i sell.


I know you can't ""eat equity"", but is it foolish to at least invest in it?"
7045,realestateinvesting,Best ways to set up a rent-to-own?,"Does anyone put their houses up for rent to own? How do you do it to avoid trouble with the frank dodd act?

I may end up losing the house in the long run, but I will make profit from the rent and selling of it (and if the tenant decides not to buy, or can't follow through on their end, I still get to keep the property).

Does anyone do this regularly? Are there other options that you normally do that are similar to this? Thank you."

That said, I don't envision being able to easily acquire other properties in Southern California very easily. 

I wanted to get the subs thoughts on investing in other, low cost regions, outside of where you live.  Certainly there is a risk of not knowing the markets well, of vacancy, of tenant issues, but does anyone do that?

"
7055,realestateinvesting,Let's get creative,"So, I'm a beginner to all this.  The property is a fixed up duplex, the owner is very motivated. Current with payments but ready to let the house go to the bank. They purchased it years ago for about $100k, they tried to sell it on the market for $85k with no luck.  It's currently completely vacant but ready to be rented. The owner really needs to get $75k for it but the rents aren't high enough in my opinion to warrant that price.  The 2 bed could probably rent for $600, and the 1 bed probably $400.  Numbers seem decent on the surface but property taxes here are 3% and water/sewage would probably run about $250 a month. Tenants pay other utilities.  


Seller is very motivated.  I'm nervous about doing any subject to deals because when the interest rates rise the banks are more likely to call the due on sale clause (source: they did this last time interest rates were low then jumped).  That leaves a lease option as a possible scenario but I'm not confident in the appreciation for this area.. I think the area will either stay the same or go down hill a little over the next five years.  Seller is very motivated but pretty firm on the price.  Thoughts?"
7056,realestateinvesting,How to determine equity positions in investment,"Using a throwaway here...I may have the chance to do a rehab/flip with an experienced flipper. I have never done one but have always wanted to. I am very handy and have managed reno projects before.

What are some typical equity positions (besides splitting everything 50/50)? The experienced person is out of state and I don't think they would plan to be involved in the day-to-day. I would be on the ground at the project doing the work and managing everything, but likely not putting up a lot of capital (if any) to actually purchase the house.

ETA: I would likely be buying materials and providing oversight/project management and/or doing as much of the work myself as I could.

All suggestions/advice welcome...thanks."

I'm looking to buy in an area with fairly low property values, so I could easily buy a duplex for less than 100K. 

However, I'm planning on living on one side and renting out the other, so I'm not sure if I should go up to 200K and buy a property that I'd probably rather live in and that would likely require less updating.

About six months ago an investor I know asked if I could possibly offer advice to a friend of his who was upside down on a property. I said I'd be happy to listen and offer suggestions. I also asked if he was ok with me making money if the opportunity arose and the answer was, ""Not at all."" Fair enough.

The subject property was a 3/2.5 town home built in 2005 toward the height of the bubble. The owners were now divorced and both lived out of town with one party living out of state. The property had been purchased for $160,000 and was now worth about $110,000. There were a significant number of foreclosures in the neighborhood. I personally do not invest in town homes or condos so I had no interest in buying this property.

The initial financial information I was provided with showed the subject property had a mortgage payment including PITI of about $1050 a month. The property was rented for $1085 a month. I figured, good for them, at least they aren't losing money and are actually making a little net profit. However, as with any purchase, you should confirm all information.

My initial call with the two owners, both professionals and intelligent people, led to some surprises. Chief among them? That the owners were actually losing several hundred dollars a month. Since the subject property was a town home, it seemed odd that there was no HOA payment. I asked the owners about this only to be told there was a $250 a month HOA payment. Wait...what?

So now we have gone from being net positive by $35 a month to being negative by $215 a month. Ok. I next asked if they were having any challenges in managing the tenants. They replied that they really didn't know since they used a property management company. Uh...no one mentioned anything about property management expenses. It comes out that they are paying a property management company $110 a month to manage the property. So now we are at NEGATIVE $325 a month on the property. Wow.

It gets better. I start reading through the property management paperwork they signed. There was an initial $300 ""intake fee"", a $75 x 4 fee for ""quarterly inspections"" and the best one...if they are fired as the property management company and the tenant they placed stays...the still receive their monthly property management fee as long as the tenant stays in the property. W.T.F? I couldn't decide what was more outrageous. That a property management company would have the gall to have that kind of BS in their contract or that two well educated professionals would sign it. Six months later and I'm still a bit astounded.

After taking all of this information in, digesting it and explaining to the owners what their true financials are, I propose the following solution:

In return for a lease that is $50 less than the current rent and an option for $2,000 less than what they owe on the property, I will manage their property and work toward making it break even.

Initially, this is what is taking place:

I receive a lease for $1035 a month and in turn I lease the property for $1085 a month. Net profit to me is $50/mo. ($600 a year). I also receive an option to purchase the property for $2,000 less than they currently owe on it. All of this is with no money out of my pocket, merely solving a problem and I have created extra income each month with a bit of money from the option in the future.

The owners are now losing $60 a month LESS than they were, my $50 vs previous $110 property management fee. Now the owners are negative $275 a month. Not a significant difference, but better than nothing.

So how do we make this better for both myself and the owners? Well, I'm glad you asked!

I'm going to advertise the property as a lease with option to purchase. I'll take a $3,000 - $5,000 option consideration which goes to me. I'm going to lease the property for $1300 a month which should allow the owners to break even and put another $50 a month in my pocket. The individual who I grant the option to will receive $100-$150 a month in credit towards the purchase price which I will set about $2,000 higher than MY option price.

If my time estimates are correct, in 3-5 the value of the property will rise enough vs the accumulated credit + option consideration to allow the individuals I gave the option to the opportunity to purchase at a nice price.

So...in my perfect world scenario...

Owners break even for 5 years and make money at the sale.

I make $100 a month, 3k-5k up front and 2k on the back end.

Buyers get to save up money and build credit toward purchasing the property."

7095,realestateinvesting,"First investment a 2-family home, renting to family.....bad idea?","Hello Real Estate Investing-
  
  
Firstly, I want to say two things:  
- I am a complete newbie (never purchased any property before), and that   
- In the case I am going to explain, I am NOT looking to completely maximize my investment. I know it sounds crazy but hear me out.
  
   
Background:   
  
I am 28, Live in CA with roughly $2K of ""Extra"" money each month. I am from the East Coast. My mother (58) is not in a great place financially (got screwed over in a messy divorce, etc.) and needs to move soon.
    
My Idea:
  
I can definitely afford to buy a 2-family house near where my mom lives. I can put down a deposit and the mortgage would be about $1,200/Month. My family is local to that area and are all carpenters so the support system is there (if a gutter blows off in a rainstorm, toilet leaks, etc. I can call someone I trust to fix it).  If I bought a house, rented out one unit to a tenant and the other to my mom (at a reduced market rate) which left me in the hole $1,200/year (figuring mortgage, insurance, repairs, etc.), is that a terrible idea?
  

  
As I said, I've never purchased real estate before but am very interested in it and think this may be a good way to get into it, seeing as how I would already trust one tenant. Even though I wouldn't be generating a monthly cashflow, I would be getting equity...... I know this isn't the mantra of this subreddit and real estate investing in general, but is I a terrible idea? I figure that although I wont be getting as much as I could, I would be helping her out and gaining equity over time.
  

I've been thinking of it as ""I'm paying the down payment for the ability to gain ~$1,000 in equity a month which I can liquidate when I'm older and need it more"""

7106,realestateinvesting,Questions about construction permits for pre-existing construction,"Hi, I'm looking to buy my first home (San Diego County, California). I found a home that has an addition that wasn't built with a permit. The official specs of the home is 1 bed/1 bath 700 sq ft., and the actual size is 2 bed/1 bath with a sunroom, and it looks to be around 1000 sq ft. The price is 160k. The addition seems to be of sufficient quality stick-built construction.

I checked other houses in the area, and there a lot of the 700 size running 90k-160k, but there are also a lot of 2 bedroom 1000 sq ft. homes for 200k+.

So my questions are: If I buy this home, can I get some kind of inspection + permit, and a new assessment and/or appraisal, so that I gain ~40k on the value just by completing these steps? 

If so, would it be very difficult to be approved for the permit?

If it is not difficult, would you agree this is a good investment for a 1st time home buyer?"
7107,realestateinvesting,Buying a fixer-upper short sale - Have I thought of everything?,"I've fixated on a fixer upper. Place is quite a mess. First it's a short sale, listed at $79,900. Realtor thinks all fixed up it's worth about $95-100,000. Due to it being a short sale, the power is off and has been listed since May 5. Now is probably a good time to tell you I live in Indiana and mold is likely an issue. 

Realtor also said it's not likely the bank will come down much, if they do I'm looking at $75,000. I'd love to get the house for $65k, but realistically I'd go for $70k. I'm estimating $10k in repairs assuming I don't lift a finger. (I'll likely do a lot of it myself)

Now for the damage. Since the power has been off for 3, almost 4 months, I'm thinking mold is definitely a possibility. House is on a slab, so that helps in that there isn't standing water in the basement or crawl. Next, the house stinks of animal urine. Could be cat, could be dog. Either way, I'd need to rip up all the carpet and baseboards. Wash everything and use kills on walls and slab. 

The bathrooms are disasters. Looks like someone started a reno and gave up. Floors are up, toilet is sitting in the shower, etc. There are two full baths, I expect to have to contract out both to be renovated.

I'm more than likely going to be starting this project solo for the demo. I'll rip up carpets and Kilz everything. I'll take care of all the painting as well. Then, I'll contract out floors and bathrooms. 

Of course this is all pending inspection and assuming nothing catastrophic is wrong. I have an HVAC I'd use to keep costs down on getting that running. Of course, I don't know if it works because there is no power to the house. 

TL;DR I want to buy a short sale fixer upper. What do I need to know? What else do I need to think about? Any and all knowledge, expertise, suggestions welcome. "

Ideally, I'd like to enter in basic property info, then be able to set up a series of tweaks I'd like to run and compare side-by-side. I'd also like to see if any of those result in a property that meets my investment criteria, then save the deals that work so I can come back to them during the negotiation process.

Btw, I've found http://www.zilpy.com/, which looks really nice, but still doesn't quite have the analysis functionality I'm looking for.

I am relatively new to property investing but like the idea of this.  Am I a sucker for thinking this is a good idea?  Are there any obvious downsides to this type of arrangement?  I would own the properties outright, as far as I can tell Platinum just takes a cut of the sale.

I talked with my bank about getting a commercial loan that would cover all 4 of my current properties as well as the new 6 unit property. This would mean losing the lower rate financing I have currently on the homes (between 3.125 - 4.875) and everything going to 5%. The bank wants to wrap everything into one 10 year loan at 5% ARM ($273,615 total for all).

:--|:--|
Currently Owe|$80,000 on the 4 units|
Current Worth|$195,000 for the 4 units|
Current PITI|$935.69 per month|
Current Rents|$2,575 per month (gross)|
New Purchase|$192,000 for the 6 unit|
New Amt Owed|$273,615 for all 10 units|
New PITI|$3,452.11|
New Utilites|$218 per month (water only)|
New Rent|$4,980|

The 6 unit property has no mortgage on it currently. My thoughts are that I could have the current owner carry a second mortgage for 30% of the value, and have the bank finance the other 70%, which would allow me to keep my current lower rate financing on my current properties.

The less likely option would be to have him owner finance the entire purchase.

Our plan is to form an LLC (unless instructed otherwise by you fine folks) and purchase a home sometime in early to mid 2016. Our initial intent is to live in the home for a year or two, as we feel it will be much cheaper than renting in apartments from a monthly perspective, and a safer place to put your money than some property management company, aka throwing it away. 



We then plan to rent it out and do the same thing with another house just to gain the experience with looking for homes, the purchasing/mortgage process, and general home ownership that two mid 20 yr old males don't have.



Main concerns:

- Is starting an LLC a good decision initially? We thought that'd be the best way since we plan on renting the home at a later point...just not sure of the differences in taxing, insurance, ""bankability"", etc.

- We're trying to start small and build up. So we're in a southern town that is rapidly growing (Greenville, SC) and has relatively cheap, available real estate that we feel we can capitalize on. Is this a safe place to start?

- Lastly, does this seem like an appropriate model for us to get our feet wet in the real estate investing niche? We don't want to get overextended from a cash flow perspective, nor do we feel that we're ready to buy a ""fixer upper"" since we've never even owned a house to begin with. So, in trying to find a middle ground, we're looking at houses that have had some work done, could use some more cosmetic stuff that we can do ourselves, allow us to continue saving for a future purchase, and are in good areas that can realize solid growth over the next 3-5 years.

7176,realestateinvesting,Tenant renewal question,"I have a current tenant who has been great, and currently handled through a third party property manager.

Unfortunately, he has to move out early.  He's requested to find a replacement tenant to take up the remainder of his lease, and to have this new tenant sign on a 12 month lease.

Normally I would not have an issue with this, provided the tenant passes all the checks.  However, my concern is that I want to move back into the unit.  This creates the possibility for some significant vacancies if the timeline doesn't work out.

So here are two possible scenarios:

1) current tenant finds a new one and signs for a 12 month lease.  In summer 2016, when this is up for renewal, the new tenant either renews the lease for just 6 months, or I have to find a tenant on a short lease.

2) tenant finds new tenant to fulfill current lease, in the fall 2015 timeframe this new tenant either renews for a year, or I find someone else to move in.  I try to get this new tenant to extend for a month or two in the fall of 2016 before I move in.

Is there a recommended way forward? Course of action 1 has me potentially eating 6 months of lost rent if the new tenant does not renew and I can't find someone to take a short risk.  Course of action 2 is probably easier for the tenants (they have to find someone for a standard 12 month lease).

I'm leaning heavily toward course of action 1 as it minimizes my own risk, and I don't think puts an undue burden on my current tenant.  However my property manager is recommending the second course of action.  I am not convinced our interests are aligned in this matter.

For what it's worth, I am in a high demand area. "

New to Reddit (Love it already) and want my first post to be something that I have heard many different answers to, but would love the Reddit Community thoughts.

What do you generally look for in your HML. As a lender, its best for me to know what the masses of investors appreciate and look for. Is it points, interest rate, time of close, underwriting process? Whats your top 3 most important things?"

7192,realestateinvesting,"First steps, and first calls","So I figured an update was due after my previous post.   
  
I did drop the mailers that Saturday, then a second set this Tuesday.

I've mailed around 550 purchased postcards, and 75 hand written yellow letters. Got my first seller call from the first mail set. Guy wanted $215k for a place that I saw comps would be about $190-250k. Not a deal. He seemed open to seller financing which was cool, but the numbers just didn't work.   
  
Got two calls today from the yellow letters I dropped on Tuesday. A triplex and duplex. Triplex guy just kept asking for an offer, so I told him I'd do some research and call him back. I can't find any good comps - almost no MF sold in the area, and of the ones sold in the past two years they were either 30% or more larger, or were in need of a fair amount of rehab. Called him back and left a message. Want him to name a price, but just can't figure out what to offer if he pushes me. Thinking $150-160. Rents would be I'd guess $1900 at the lowest, could be up to $2400 if I'm optimistic(it's empty now). So 150 would be low for that area.   
  
Other seller has a duplex - and is motivated. Is headed to court tomorrow for an eviction for one of their tenants, and complained about tenants over and over. They just seem really unrealistic on price. Can't find any comps nearby at all -  2 sales of MF in a mile radius in 2013. Rents are 1600 and 650, with the 650 side getting evicted. He asked for $300k, which I think is way overpriced. Based on general market data, there aren't many places in that area going for over $200k.   
  
So he wants me to drive by the place(can't get inside due to poor tenant relations). I suspect he'd be open to terms as well, but need a reasonable price. I can't pay 25% or more over what I should.

7196,realestateinvesting,Considering first time REI property - nonprofit worker,"I found myself in an unusual situation this year, as I started a nonprofit job that allows me to work from anywhere, in any time zone. I live (rental) in an expensive urban city right now - San Francisco!. I'm unwilling to move away since I moved around a lot in my 20s and am finally growing roots in one place. However, my parents live in Missouri, in a good school district, and own two homes. I'm considering spending part of the year living with them, with a much lower cost of living, and saving up money for a down payment on a property in the area. They have experience managing one SFH, and have offered to help me figure out the ropes and even help me with the down payment (although I would prefer to pay on my own, getting their assistance by living with them for cheap rent instead). I still plan on spending part of the year in the Bay, so I can feel like I'm not throwing away I life I carefully carved out for myself there. 

My questions are basically - is this feasible? Is this a good idea? Although I don't make much in my job, I feel like the flexibility of location and time zone means that I should take advantage to save up some money by living partially, if not wholly, in a low cost of living area, and use that money for something like a down payment. As a nonprofit worker, I will never own a home in San Francisco unless I win the lottery or something and having my own personal home is not something I dream of. However, the idea of owning rental properties for investments sounds awesome and exciting. Is this a pipe dream?

7197,realestateinvesting,Land Lording Discussion: Critical Potential Tenants,"**Intro: Skip Down to the Story to Jump Right In**

Initially the most frightening aspect of being a real estate investor I faced was property management. Through experience and constant improvement it is now one of my two favorite parts of being a real estate investor. Every now and then a random circumstance will take place that at one time would have flustered me. Hopefully by sharing these experiences we will create discussion for everyone on this sub.

It has been my experience that most people want to help others and be kind. Unfortunately that mentality in land lording will at some point in time end up biting you in the butt in the form of an eviction at best or massive damages at worst. Does this mean you can't be a kind and benevolent landlord? Of course not.

As a real estate investor you must realize that you are responsible for the ownership of an asset that is worth a significant amount of money. You have invested in this asset with the goal of making a profit...preferably in both net positive cash flow each month and long term equity. When you place a tenant in an investment property you are taking a risk. You are trusting this person will not damage your asset. This is why developing a good system of management is important. You mitigate risk.

Personally, as an investor, my portfolio is entirely SFH's with 80% of them being middle class and the other 20% working class. I do not own any property in low income areas although when I first started out as an investor I did. These homes are in good to great condition and areas.

My team and I recently finished rehabbing a home. We went down to the studs. Everything in this house is new but the roof and the original concrete block. You walk into the house and it smells new. The home sits on a cul-de-sac in a nice, middle class neighborhood.

**Story**

We hold the first open house for the home this past Sunday. We had roughly twenty inquiries off a Postlets which means for this area I expect roughly five people to show up.

Right on time, at 12PM, the first car pulls up. From inside the house I can see the car isn't in great shape. As the occupants exited the vehicle it was apparent they were likely not quite the quality of the other families in this neighborhood (before some jerk plays the race card...they were white). Nonetheless you never know so I put on a smile and greeted them.

It was a Grandmother (50's), her daughter (20's) and her daughter. No way around it...they were trashy. So we have a completely rehabbed house and in about two minutes the Grandmother starts criticizing that it is ""ok"" but ""not that nice"" and so on and so forth.

I've been doing this long enough that I wasn't upset, I was amused. The rare occasions I've found someone who likes to play this little game I have a little game I like to play back. So I asked, ""What is your gross monthly income?""

The Grandmother asked, ""Why would you ask that?""

I replied, ""Well ma'am I'm the property manager and the owners have a few requirements that must be met for us to consider providing a potential resident the opportunity to rent this nice home."" I continued, ""As this home rents for $1100 a month, we would require you to be able to show a minimum of $3300 a month in income. Can you do that?""

Silence.

After about 10 seconds Grandma composed herself enough to say, ""We have a Section 8 voucher.""

My reply, ""Ma'am we don't accept Section 8. That being said, I do know a property management company in this area who does. Would you like their name and number?""

I give them the info and off the go. The next two potential residents who stopped by were good and great. I'd rent to either of them but if I have to make a decision between the two I would go with the latter.

**Random Thoughts**

Several thoughts and suggestions for new investors:

1) You have a valuable asset. Don't just put ANYONE in there. Have standards and always follow them. I'll leave a home empty for months in order to find the right tenant who I believe will stay there for at least five years.

2) Appearances can be deceiving. I've had people driving Mercedes asking to rent a home only to find they have multiple evictions.

3) If someone is rude or pushy (which is unusual) be polite in return. If you struggle with getting angry, practice patience and have a friend or SO role play with you by being belligerent (could be fun).

4) Trust your gut.

5) Get to know potential tenants. I actually keep my  leases out of site during showings. If I spend 10-15 minutes talking to someone and they have potential, I offer them a lease.

6) Learn to acquire information without being over the top or even worse violating any type of law. After a few minutes I nonchalantly ask, ""So what keeps ya'll busy during the week?"". I look for conversation cues such as are they wearing a hat or shit from a particular university, do they have kids, etc. I'm always looking for small clues that I can ask friendly questions about that assist me in determining if they may be a good tenant.

7) Have your STANDARDS. I know this is a bit of a repeat. Personally, we don't care about credit. There are a LOT of good people with bad credit. I care about: No prior evictions, no arrests for violent crimes, major drug offenses, sex crimes and felonies, must make at least 3x the gross rent monthly and must have been working at the same job for at least 6 months with the last two pay stubs available. I call both their job and previous landlord and vet them as tenants.

None of the above is meant as an ""end all, be all"" of land lording. Hopefully it provides some thoughts and ideas that you find valuable or worthy of discussion.

I'm 27, just got done with film school that I went back for. I love film making but I want to be able to work on my own content and I'd rather not work for other people. SO, I recently discovered real estate investing, which seems like a relatively easier method of making money.

Don't get me wrong, I know you get out of it what you put in, and I'm all for that. However, I was wondering if you folks think this is the kind of thing I could do part time, while focusing on creating content the rest of the time. 

Additionally, with the research I've done (lots of Youtube, and lots of Biggerpockets.com) I've heard people suggest becoming a ""master"" in a particular niche. I was wondering what people's opinions are about me focusing specifically on probate investing."

7209,realestateinvesting,"[X-post /r/landlord] Tenant lease is expiring. They'll renew 12 months IF we reduce the rent by $100/month. LL of Reddit, what would you do?","The rental property is conveniently located downtown in a desirable historic neighborhood (1920's - 1950's style homes).  The tenants are good tenants - working professionals, pay on time, no complaints, etc.  The rental property is old (historic), but updated &amp; maintained. Like most historic homes, it has lots of character, but with that comes it's quirks &amp; imperfections.  Anytime a repair is needed, I've responded immediately which they acknowledged and appreciate.  They tell me they love the home and hope to stay, but a $100/mo reduction in rent would make them very happy. 

The reasons they feel compelled to ask for a rent reduction:

- Main focus being finances
- The A/C broke twice (the issue was fixed within 24-48 hours)
- Termite swarms (pest control fixed this issue. common problem in wood frame homes in Florida)
- Some safety issue (shed in backyard broke into, cars on the street vandalized)
- High electric bill. Electric company states appliances are using significant amounts of energy (previous tenants never complained about high bills, IMO this could be due to their usage / habits)

My feelings:

* The rent is comparable for the area.  Although the (new construction) high rises, mid rises, and apartments of comparable sq ft charge nearly twice the rent I do (they offer amenities &amp; everything is new).  
* I won't have any issues renting it out if they choose to leave at the end of their lease, but it will require my time to turn the unit over, advertise, and get new tenants (I live 1.5 hours away).  
* My costs have increased.  Property taxes went up almost 18%.  I need to budget for new gutters.

Landlords of Reddit, what would you do and how would you respond to the tenants?

7214,realestateinvesting,Need some motivation or advice,"I’ve been researching, reading, planning, and thinking intensely about real estate for three months. Decided on doing direct mail, and ordered some postcards. They arrived Tuesday. Now I’m freaking out a little. I’m getting qualms saying I’m not ready to do a deal. 

I don’t have a title company lined up, and not sure how. A little scared to cold call one and ask if they do double closes. 

I don’t know if the call script I cobbled together will work. I stole what I thought were the best ideas from a few websites, but just not sure about it. Don’t know what I should say to sellers when I walk through their homes either. I should be using that time to sell myself as a buyer, and also push for a lower price. Not sure how to do that.

I have a purchase agreement, but think it needs to be modified. It’s the MN Bar standard PA, but as a wholesaler and investor I probably want to modify it to be more favorable to me, as well as more readable and easy to understand for a seller. 

Then there’s Minneapolis’ TISH requirement. You have to sign a statement as the buyer saying you’ll fix code violations found during the mandatory pre-sale inspection. Only way to do a double close that way would be to use an LLC. So I’d have to create an LLC, put funds in a bank account, etc. Not sure what all else I’d need to do.

Less worrying but still in the back of my mind – finding buyers. My gf works with contractors, and has a list of 2-3000 that she could call. Shouldn’t be an issue, but I’d be cold calling these guys. And, more importantly, I need to make sure I’m estimating repairs and ARV correctly. A guy told me houses with 3 BR on one level are worth more than ones with 3 BR on separate levels. I had no idea. What else am I ignorant of?   

Part of me wants to drop the mailers on Saturday, and research while waiting for calls. Another part is saying I need to figure these things out before I even think about sending them out. The 4th holiday doesn't help. I shouldn't send out mailers any later than Monday next week, because far too many people will be on vacation, so the mailers will get lost in the pile when they get home. Not sure I want to wait 10 days to start mailing.

7223,realestateinvesting,First Deal of 2015: Lease with Option to Purchase,"This deal involves: **Lease with Option to Purchase, Marketing and Property Management.**

In January, a good investor friend of mine picked up a property in a very desirable location. This is what many of us would consider an ""up and coming"" area. Twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings are buying older homes in the area and updating them. Most of the buyers and renters in this locale would be considered ""trendy"" types who appreciate the micro-breweries and unique stores that have opened up.

At the time I asked my friend what he was planning to do with the property and he responded that, ""I got it for a steal"" and that he was going to rent it out for a few years. I congratulated my friend on finding this deal and proceeded on with pursuing my own opportunities.

A few months later the property in question popped up on my buddies ""For Sale"" list that he puts out every week. I inquired about the property but the terms he was offering only made sense to a retail buyer. Fast forward to six weeks ago and I inquired about the property again, he told me that, ""It is under contract.""

Two weeks ago at a local real estate meeting he puts the property on the board for deals once more. I ask what happened and he informs me the buyer backed out. As previously mentioned, this investor is a buddy of mine so when I ask him what the deal is, he lets me know. Basically one of his private capital sources put up the money for the property and he has three years to do something with it.

I ask him if I decide I can do something with it if he will lease it to me with an option to purchase. He says he is looking to close another deal and could use $5,000 so this makes sense to him as the property is not making him any money at the moment.

When I pull up to the property for the first time, the exterior looks even better in person. Nice landscaping, the front yard and front of the house is clean and there is a big oak tree. The neighborhood is quiet and church is next door. Knowing the neighborhood and knowing what a 3/1 house should rent for in this neighborhood I was a little shocked that the house hadn't rented out at $1050 a month.

Upon entering the house, I rapidly realized the challenges the home was facing from both a retail sale and rental perspective. The house obviously hadn't sold at a retail price as the completed rehab work was basic. The work wasn't bad for a rental unit but it certainly wasn't high end enough to sell at the retail price that my friend was asking.

Walking through the house I understood why no one had rented the home either...even at $850 a month which was $250 under market for that area. There was dirt, leaves and other debris on the floor. The mirrors, sinks, stove, refrigerator and toilet were grimy. No one in their right mind would have rented this 

That being said the house was awesome. Most of the rooms had hardwood floors but the kitchen and bath floors were a fantastic, old school, black and white checkerboard tile from the 50's. The backyard was beyond huge with various citrus trees producing honest to god citrus. This house definitely deserved a place in my portfolio.

I called my friend and let him know we had a deal...and here is an item newer investors may want to consider. In our area, there are hundreds if not thousands of ""investors"". Out of those thousands there are a few that actually know what they are doing and understand how important relationships are in this space. Our deal was a handshake deal. It took us a week to get around to completing it with official paperwork...because both of us know how important our reputations are and both of us expect to be real estate investing ten, twenty, thirty or more years from now.

So...I had a property under contract...time to rent it out. The first step I took was to do some basic cleaning. My normal cleaning lady was sick so I spent about two hours cleaning areas that would appear in the marketing pictures.

The next step I took was to stage the house. I believe staging a property to rent is exceptionally important. You are giving a prospective tenant a vision of the rental property being their home.

Considerations regarding staging: I don't stage with furniture and I stage with the intent of appealing to the female tenant (wife/girlfriend) as they make the decision 99% of the time. So if I don't stage with furniture, what do I stage with? All of my staging materials come from the local dollar store. I've got a box with about $50 worth of supplies in there to mock up the house.

Items that I believe are must haves: Any of the twist top air fresheners that don't require power, a new hand soap container by each sink in the house, shower rod and shower curtain in the shower, toilet paper in the bathroom, towels on the towel rack in the bathroom, hand towels and paper towels in the kitchen and fake plants in various rooms of the house. I have a few other items but those are the main pieces I always put out. I also have a few water bottles and a small candy dish with peppermints that I encourage people to indulge in.

With the house mocked up I uploaded the pictures and pertinent info to Postlets. Holy ****balls! I had over 20 contacts in the first 24hrs and 40 contacts over the first three days. That is a new personal record for that time frame.

The first hour of the first open showing day the second person who came in, a female says, ""This is the house I want."", filled out her rental app and gave me the application fees, rent lock and first month. She and her husband passed their background check with flying colors and boom we were done. That quick!


Finance notes: I rented the property for $1100 + a monthly pet fee of $25 x 3 Pets = $1175 a month. If our tenants pay on or before the first, they receive a discount of $100. My payment on this house is $750 a month. So $1075 discounted rent - $750 = $325 per month net profit.

My option consideration is $5,000. $325 x 12 = $3900 / $5,000 = a 78% cash on cash return after one year. This will of course drop if I have any expenses.

My option period is for 30 months and my price is $92,000. Currently I estimate the house at a value of $100,000 - $110,000.

My current exit strategies are:

1) Least Favorable: Sell the house in 30 months and take an estimated $325 x 30 profit + $10,000 sale of home profit. If my math is correct this would be a profit of $19,950 in 30 months on a $5,000 investment. Not too shabby.

2) Preferred: I like this house. If it is a good house over the next few years I'll either do a few deals specifically to pay for this house cash, refinance it with an IRA or sell a house I like less and 1031 the money in this house.

**Important Lesson**: Many investors get over eager and over anxious about closing deals. You will find more often than not that some of your best deals are opportunities that come back to you months or even years after your first looked at them. If an amazing opportunity jumps up in front of you than by all means secure it as quickly as possible. However patience can bring many deals back around once a Seller has exhausted other possibilities...and now you have an opportunity to make an even better deal as you are their last option."

7240,realestateinvesting,Short sale opportunities coming?,"I attended a presentation last night talking about real estate and how the market is doing. The presenter said he thinks another wave of foreclosures is coming due to option ARMS. These loans gave the sellers three choices.    

1) Normal payments  
2) Interest only payments  
3) Less than full interest only payments  
  
So people could pay less than just the interest, and the extra would get added to principal. The speaker said most of these loans were 10 year option ARMs, so they're going to be resetting in the next 1-3 years - with monthly payment increases of $600 at minimum.   
  
Standard deals won't work here, because the house is likely underwater. You'd have to work out a short sale somehow. Anyone have thoughts on this?"

Advice greatly appreciated, DC Metro Area.","My in laws have tasked me and my wife to find them a suitable rental property.  They have given us around 100k and I've been trying to wrap my head around utilizing this money in the best way possible.  We live in Northern VA, and housing costs exceed rental rates.  I'm very new to the world of REI but have been reading and researching on this forum as well as Biggerpockets to better understand what constitutes a good investment.

The property I am considering purchasing right now is a short sale Townhouse.   I may be missing some vital numbers but will provide what I have at the moment:  

2400 Sqft, Townhome, 3Br, 3.5 Ba, 1 Car garage, Deck

Purchase price: 360k
Comp Sales : 390k

Down Payment : 90k (98k Closing costs)

Rent-o-meter for this neighborhood : ~$2100

10-15 min commute to Reston, VA, (an up and coming tech hub in this region), Realtor says its a ""great area"".  

Monthly Payments would be $1700 after taxes/insurance/hoa


I thought $400 was a decent positive cash flow, but I failed to factor in vacancy, and other costs.  I'm not quite sure what my return on cash is either.  From what I gather, savvy investors would rather use the power of leverage and purchase several cheaper properties to achieve more cash flow.  I'm nowhere near the 1% rule, and the other 50% rule I fail to remember at this moment.  My in laws are not overly ambitious and just wanted to put their savings to use rather than sit in a savings account.  They prefer it be nearby and this property is only 15 mins away from my primary residence.  Still, if I were able to provide a much better return on their money, everything else goes out the window.

One of my main concerns is the impact it has on my ability to purchase subsequent rental properties in the future.    MY DTI is already high, and my loan officer said it will hit 42% with this new purchase.   I'm not sure if that's factoring in future rental income or not.  My wife and I make 160k gross a year.  However, we currently pay 3300 a month for our primary residence.  I understand we would have to wait 2 years regardless to establish rental income before buying a 3rd property.    I believe that real estate will be my best chance at financial independence in the next 10-15 years and am lucky to be in this position.   I am wondering if this potential purchase will take me out of the REI game before I even get started.  
I apologize if this post is unfocused and disorganized but I typed it on a whim.  I need to decide on this current townhouse soon.  I will try to format this post better later today or tomorrow but greatly appreciate any advice in the mean time, Thank you!!

***Background***

This lead was brought to me by a realtor (insert record scratching sound). I can hear it now, ""But wait GG! You always talk about how much you hate realtors!""  I don't HATE realtors, I dislike them immensely. It isn't personal, more from the perspective of if they'd shut their pie hole and do what I ask of them they'd make a lot of money. However, I digress.

This realtor isn't REALLY a realtor. He is a second generation investor who happens to have mortgage brokers license.

We were at a meeting together and he mentioned that he had a home in an area that I invest in but no one else at this particular meeting really does. He said there was the possibility of a lease with option to purchase or a subject-to and gave me the address.

The home is a beautiful property about 30 minutes North of the large city I live in. A 4/2, 1400sq ft, built in 1998. I estimate the rent is $1400-$1500.

The home is listed for sale through my realtor friend for almost 170k. Knowing that area, I figure it is worth about 140k. I ask him what is going on with the sales price and he said that the Seller is selling for that amount in an attempt to break even after closing costs, etc. since their loan balance is 150k. Makes sense to me.

I learn the owner is out of state (great start) and now I know they just want to break even (even better). So we have a scenario for a highly motivated seller.

As the house has no equity...and likely a small amount of negative equity...it makes no sense for me to engage in the expense of a closing and taking the property subject-to. I offer a lease with option to purchase scenario and ask my realtor friend how he will get paid.

Being a smart investor he says that the owner will pay him 10% of the expected commission of the option price up front and the balance when the home sells in the future. I do a little quick math and that number ends up being a hair over $1000. Umm...yes please!

One outstanding piece of information here is missing. I know the MORTGAGE payments on the home are about $990 a month. HOA fees are $20 a month. This takes us to about $1010 a month. The challenge is what will be the total payment per month including taxes and insurance. If I can only rent the house for $1300 a month and the Mortgages, Taxes, Insurance and HOA come to $1300 a month...it makes no sense to execute this deal.

Why? Most of you will quickly grasp if my costs are $1300 a month and the rent is $1300 a month I break even. I don't invest to break even or lose money...and maintenance costs would mean I lose money. I do believe this property will increase in value over the next few years but I'm an investor, not a speculator. So I'm not going to lose money each month HOPING the value goes up.

So how could I make money on this property if it breaks even? Who could possibly wait for five to seven years and speculate on the growth of the property without too much worry? A dumb investor would be one answer...but not the correct answer. A self-directed IRA would be the correct answer.

If I get this property under contract and it won't cash flow for me but isn't a huge hell hole of cash loss, I could sell my option for a profit to a SD-IRA. If the property increases 30k in value over the next 7yrs (a possibility) the IRA isn't going to pay taxes on the profit and likely won't care if they spent 10k in maintenance over 7 years.

You will also notice I made the terms contingent upon finding a tenant. Until I find a suitable tenant, the owner will continue to make payments on the property.

7264,realestateinvesting,An Owner Financing Learning Scenario,"TBC. A small teaching scenario with /u/BrokenGlassEverywher

This concept was the result of a discussion in a thread on /r/realestate from individuals who believed real estate could not meet the ""1% rule"" in their area due to prices. I suppose the 1% rule is a good baseline for people who are just starting out on their investor journeys. I personally hadn't heard of it until I was 7 or 8 years in as an investor and realized it had no relevance to what I was doing.

/u/themasterkser has volunteered to assist me with this exercise. *Round of Applause*

Scenario: Middle class homes in your area sell for 500k. However they only rent for 3k a month. What is an offer you could make to purchase this home and still cash flow?

Before you even get to make an offer, what is the first question you should ask? /u/themasterkser you are up! =)

**/u/themaskerkser reply**

&gt;Ok, so the first question I would ask myself is how much margin I would want per month to cover expenses like repairs, management, non occupancy, etc.
Then I'd combine that estimate with the rental estimate to come up with a bottom line ""net potential"" for the property.
With a ""net potential"" in mind, what remains is to decide what is the acceptable direct property cost range. This range represents a trade between having higher cash flow but harder to close a deal vs lower cash flow but more potential to close.
How about that as a starting point?

Great. I actually meant to ask ""What is the first question you should ask the Seller?""

Since I mis-typed, I'll address your first response and then answer my own question! =)

You mentioned some great information that everyone should certainly be engaging a Seller. That information shouldn't come from Zillow...in particular the ""Rent Estimate"". Either be familiar with the rent rates in the area you or buying or call on some other rentals in the area and see what they are renting for.

Once you have an idea of the how much the home will rent for, you can then quickly back out taxes, insurance, maintenance and the net profit you'd like to make.  This should leave you with the sum that you could pay a property owner monthly (or a mortgage if you use banks).

With that being said, to answer my own question, ""What is the first question I ask a Seller?"". My first question is, ""Why are you Selling such a nice house?""

Even if a home requires some repair or is literally falling down the first few minutes of the conversation aren't the time to be negative. Put yourself on the side of the Seller. You are looking to have the Seller invest in YOU and tell YOU what THEIR story is.

Many times my leads are warm introductions but I wait for the Seller to acknowledge that they know that I know. This is important as just because I know Great Aunt Edna died I may not know if it was expected or sudden. There is grief in both of those situations but if it was sudden I'm of the opinion it may make the emotions more raw for the Seller.

Think about if you are dealing with a couple who is behind on payments because they lost a job. Think that is embarrassing for them? Think it makes more sense to allow THEM to share that story?

Even if the opposite is true and the situation is great...a job promotion or an expanding family...it is the Seller's story to share. Don't steal that opportunity from them. Allow them to share with you.

So...the first question I like to ask, ""Why are you Selling such a nice house?"" typically returns one of two responses: Either the Seller will tell you...or they won't.

Interestingly enough, in the ten years I've purchased only owner financed homes everyone has told me. The vast majority of people will share with you what they know: How much did they pay? What is their equity? What are their current payments? Etc.

That all comes later. What I'm looking for is the reason the want to sell their house. Lose a job? Get a promotion? Downsizing? Upsizing? Moving away? Behind on payments? Death or sickness in family? Divorce? So on and so forth. There are countless reasons why someone is selling. Knowing the WHY...the motivation...is what allows you to use the investor tools available to you in order to make fair offers that create a win/win (makes sense) for both you and the Seller.

More to come soon..."
7265,realestateinvesting,Example of Inquiry Letter,"This is a letter I just mailed today. There is a bit of back story behind this particular home.

About a year and a half ago I purchased the home across the street. During that time I saw a FSBO sign in the yard. One day I caught up with a man mowing the grass and asked him if he was the owner. Long story short, his Mother had owned the home and passed. He joked that he had spent his entire life mowing the grass of that home and wanted to get rid of it.

The son wasn't very open to owner financing but suggested I speak with his sister. His sister, it became rapidly apparent, was only concerned with cashing out her Mom's house as quick as possible because of ""bills"".

So I dropped it.

What most long term investors will tell you is houses have a funny way of coming back to you with time. Someone may not want to sell a house today...but if they still haven't sold it in six months or a year or more...well you may get a phone call out of the blue.

I happened to drive by my house for the first time in 18 months to go look at ANOTHER property and noticed a realtors sign in the yard of the house this story revolves around. So it STILL hasn't sold.

Let's think about this logically. 18 Months ago the family wanted 72k for the house and it is now listed with a realtor for 105k...which  it isn't worth.

So in that year in and a half, the son has had to mow the lawn, the property taxes have been paid, the roof as worn more and likely the septic tank and ac have not been run and will have to be inspected. How much money has not owner financing cost them?

I give this background only so that the familiarity with which my offer is made makes sense.

Dear X Family:

We manage the property across the street from your Mother’s home at X. A year and a half ago we spoke with a member of your family who at that time was not interested in owner financing your home.

As the home has continued to sit empty, property taxes are still being paid, the roof is getting older and the septic tank and ac will have to be inspected. Would you be open to the possibility of speaking with us once you are no longer obligated to your realtors?

We would be willing to pay a fair market value for your home if you would agree to our terms.

Offer 1: $70,000 Sale Price w/ cash at closing via note sale.
Down payment: $7,000
Payments: If you agree to owner financing, we have another investor who will buy your note at 50% of face value. As the Seller you would net at closing: $42,000.

Offer 2:  $100,000 Sale Price w/ owner financing.
Down payment: $10,000
Payments: $500/mo. until balance is paid in full.

Should you be interesting in selling this home or any other properties that you may own, we would be interested in speaking with you. I look forward to assisting you now or in the future and I wish you success regardless of the decision you make with your home.

7275,realestateinvesting,Adventures in Landlording: Handymen.,"Hi All! This isn't meant to be depressing and is actually convenient as I'm a firm believer we can learn more from the failures of ourselves and others than success. I've been considering writing a few stories about some of the negative adventures I've had in real estate investing and as this is taking place in the present time, why not.

One of the main topics I revisit when speaking about real estate investing is how do you keep your life simple as a property manager? The first part is developing a good system of finding and vetting tenants. But what about handyman? Do we take the same care in selecting them that we do our tenants?

When I first started out I was fortunate that I knew a great handyman and although I no longer have properties in that area, I refer him to other investors and homeowners who call me. My second handyman was a referral from the first and he was great as well. I then went through a stretch where I went through about 7-8 handymen over the course of a few years before I found another winner. Here are some of the qualifications I developed over that time.

1) Must have testimonials from at least three other investors/home owners along with contact information to verify.

2) Must be insured.

3) Must have a LLC.

The last two are primarily for liability and tax purposes.

I'm a firm believer that communication, or more succinctly lack of good communication skills would significantly decrease the number of conflicts we have in all aspects of our lives.

I see so many landlords just send a prospective tenant a lease instead of actually going over it. I have a ten page lease and each paragraph is a rule and expectation I expect the tenant to follow. Taking 30 minutes to go over a lease paragraph by paragraph allows me to abundantly clear and to answer their questions.

Same with Handymen. I have a list of rules I expect them to follow included but not limited to a specific way I expect the work to be documented, acceptable hours of work, punctuality and attendance. Furthermore I share with them our payment schedule and that we have a tiered payment schedule (when doing larger, month plus jobs). The first month, I expect you to work at $15 an hour. Show us you are going to do the job the way we want to and we scale you up to $17.50 after 30 Days. Continue to do things our way, we bump you up to $20 an hour after another 90 Days.

This is typically more than enough time to discover if a Handyman is going to work out for you (on larger projects and going forward).

The Story: My latest handyman adventure is a sad story. A business partner of mine had a Brother in Law who had worked as a painter for 20 years and was doing rehab work during the post-foreclosure rehab wave with banks. This handyman, we will call him Dave, had become addicted to Oxycodone and had gone to rehab.

I'm a firm believer in giving people a second chance and Dave had been out of rehab for over a year. I started him on small projects and he worked his butt off. Over a year and a half Dave worked on three major rehab projects plus small service calls here and there. Dave was one of the two best handymen I have ever worked with from both a talent and doing everything I  asked for perspective.

Unfortunately about a month ago, Dave began calling in. I went out to a job site because a particular task was taking much longer than it should have. I asked Dave when he wasn't using our Table Saw and he got a bit wide eyed and said he'd bring it the next day. As you can imagine, that was the last I saw of Dave.

I called Dave's brother in law and let him know what was going on since I suspected drug issues again. It quickly came up that Dave had started doing crystal meth and had made some other unfortunate choices. Dave's brother in law told me Dave promised to bring my money for the tools on Monday (three days later). Of course he never showed.

Dave unfortunately comes from a family of enablers. His parents stick their heads in the sand and make excuses.

After consulting with Dave's brother in law after Dave's no show I sent a text an email and a left a vm. I informed Dave he could either return my tools, replace them or provide me with the cash to replace them. After 48 hours of no response, I went to the Police.

As luck would have it, Dave had pawned this item on multiple occasions. As a result, a warrant was issued for his arrest and I suspect he'll be being picked up soon.

So what would I like you to learn by sharing this?

Surprisingly, I'm not sharing this to say ""Don't give people a chance."" On the contrary, I believe we should give people chances if it makes sense. Dave made me a LOT of money and he was doing great work until he fell of the wagon. I don't regret the decision to hire him.

I do want to share a suggestion with ya'll that I normally do but didn't this time and it almost bit me in the butt. My LLC owns some tools for larger jobs such as the table saw. I keep a spreadsheet with the serial numbers written down. This is the one time I had forgotten to write the serial number down on a tool.

**Always record the serial number of your tools**

Luckily, since it had been pawned multiple times and Dave did not have permission to pawn it, it was easy to have the Police handle this.

Overall this is a sad story of someone throwing away their life because of drugs. Perhaps my thoughts and suggestions will assist you in making a better decision in the future regarding your handymen!

To avoid the usual auto-replies, let me say that I have an emergency fund and some IRAs. I have just inherited 50k and rather than put it into another fund (which I don't like anyway), I thought I would try to buy a 2br 1ba house for about 40k and then turn it over to a property manager to rent out as of September of this year.

The home I'm looking at is close to a graduate college, in a town with low crime, decent rental rates, and very very low vacancy. This property manager has zero vacancy, for example, and the tenants are screened and tend to be graduate students or technical students who already have bachelors degrees.

Another thing of import is that I will not be living in this town, or even this state. I might not even visit for ten or more years.

I estimate that at current rental prices, I would make $6000/year gross on my 50k investment (roughly 40k for the house, plus 10k in living and fixer-upper expenses for 3 months, doing the work myself.) So I think it's conservative to estimate an average annual net income of $3,000, after paying for insurance and property taxes and property management fees and paying the property manager to handle maintenance.

And since I'm unemployed, I actually have the three months to spend doing this purchase and fix-up, which will hopefully increase the rental price. I don't know what materials will cost, but I'm handy enough that I can fix up anything that needs fixing, unless it's structural/foundation work, so I'll ask some contractor friends to look at the place before I buy.

Thank you for reading. Any thoughts or opinions?

7281,realestateinvesting,Protecting Inherited IRA's by Dyches Boddiford,"Dyches is an investor who in my humble opinion is very knowledgeable. He puts out a free newsletter every couple of months which I enjoy. You may want to consider signing up for it. This is his latest in which he discusses protecting inherited IRA's.

We all know that IRAs, particularly Roth IRAs are a great estate planning tool.  For example, if you left a Roth IRA with just $30,000 in an account earning 10% to an eight-year-old child, the distributions over the child’s lifetime would total in excess of $5 million! Completely tax-free!  But there was always the concern about beneficiaries investing the accounts wisely and only taking minimum distributions, unless they have an emergency.  Most of these concerns could be addressed with good financial education of beneficiaries. 

But now there is an even greater concern following a US Supreme court case in June 2014 concerning the protection of an inherited IRA from creditors in a bankruptcy.  The Court in a unanimous decision, ruled that funds from an inherited IRA are not protected under bankruptcy.  

In that case, Heidi Heffron-Clark inherited an IRA from her mother with a value of $450,000 in 2001.  Ms. Heffron-Clark started taking monthly distributions from the account.  When she filed for bankruptcy in 2010, the IRA only had $300,000 left.  She argued that the inherited IRA was a retirement account under the bankruptcy law and therefore exempt from creditors’ claims in bankruptcy.

But the Court found that an inherited IRA does not qualify as retirement funds, citing three reasons for this conclusion.  The inherited IRA beneficiary: 

1.  Is not allowed to make additional contributions to the account,

2.  Must take distributions regardless of how many years they are from retirement, and

3.  May withdraw the entire account balance, for any purpose, without penalty.

Therefore, the Court ordered that an inherited account is not exempt from claims of creditors against your children in bankruptcy, and potentially claims of their spouses. 

This ruling means that greater effort needs to be made to protect you IRA heritage from creditors whether it be from bankruptcy, lawsuits or divorce.  Until this court case, we worried about taxes or children wasting funds from the inherited IRA, we now also have to consider creditors as well.

We still need to address protection of the inherited IRA from the impulses and whims of the beneficiary.  Inherited IRAs are usually distributed over the life expectancy of the beneficiary under the required minimum distribution (RMD) rules.  This approach almost always ensures the lowest taxes and the highest overall value to the beneficiary.  But, the beneficiary is under no obligation to take the distribution over their lifetime.  They can take any portion or even all at once.  If they do so, they would subject themselves to a substantial tax bill and reduce the account value.

At the same time, there is a concern that the beneficiary is able to manage the account properly with appropriate investments to assure the investments will grow and not just waste away.

For smaller IRAs and mature and responsible beneficiaries, you may choose to simply leave things as they are with proper beneficiary designations.  Yes, there is a risk here that even with a responsible beneficiary, a creditor of that beneficiary could result in the loss of the inherited IRA.  But you will need to decide if the extra effort and expense is worth the protection.

The way to protect and control an inherited IRA for your non-spouse beneficiaries is to set up a separate trust known as an IRA Beneficiary Trust.  These trusts originally developed as a result of the IRS regulations governing the calculation of required minimum distributions from IRAs.  Since then, there have been several IRS private letter rulings approving the use of these types of trusts.

IRA Beneficiary Trust are an excellent way to control and protect an inherited IRA for a child or grandchild.  Besides protecting an inherited IRA from the bankruptcy of a beneficiary, these trusts can provide spendthrift protection.  They can also protect against lawsuits, general creditors and poor financial decisions of the beneficiary.  The IRA Beneficiary Trust can authorize required minimum distributions only, unless the trustee determines a different distribution is justified.

These specialized trusts can also provide extra protection and control of the IRA for the benefit of a disabled beneficiary as well, such as preserving Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.

Let’s look at an example to see how the trust would work.  Stacy is 71 and has an IRA worth $1.5 million from which she is currently taking RMDs.  She wants to leave as much of his IRA as possible to her daughter, Sally and grandson, Jim.  Sally, who is 42 years old, is a spendthrift and could cash out the inherited IRA and spend all of the money.  Jim, the other beneficiary, is only 19 years old and does not even understand what an IRA is.  In order to protect the IRA when inherited from the kids and any creditors, Stacy does the following.

Stacy has an IRA Beneficiary Trust set up with separate sub-trusts for Sally and Jim.  In this approach, the age of the beneficiary of each sub-trust would be used for calculating RMDs.   Setting up an IRA Beneficiary Trust with sub-trusts for each beneficiary is the best way to ensure the full stretch-out value of the IRA to both Sally, the spendthrift, and Jim the 19 year old with little financial knowledge.  They get their required distribution, and possibly more should the trustee allow it.  The trust also guards the trust corpus (trust assets) against creditors.  For example, if Sally fell onto hard times and ran up her credit card debt and defaulted, the IRA Beneficiary Trust would be protected from those claims.

Employer sponsored plans such as 401(k) plans, or any of the other equivalents (i.e., §457s and §403(b)s), also have potential beneficiary problems.  Once you have left the employment where you had one of these plans, it is almost always best to roll these accounts over to an IRA or your new employer’s plan.  The same IRA Beneficiary Trust can be used with the rolled over IRA when inherited.  If the account owner dies while still employed, the plan documents may have restrictions on who can be named a beneficiary.  So, it is recommended that you check with your plan administrator.

Since your spouse could treat your inherited IRA as her own, it is best to name your spouse as the primary beneficiary and the IRA Beneficiary Trust as the secondary.  If you are single, the IRA Beneficiary Trust could be the primary beneficiary.  Qualified plans can be rolled to beneficiary IRAs and the IRA trust can protect them as well. 

There are initial costs to set up the trust as well as future costs of administration and preparation of tax returns after your death.  These additional fees may be inconsequential compared to protecting the future value of the IRA.  Should you decide that an IRA Beneficiary Trust is right for your situation, there is specific language that must be used on the IRA beneficiary designation forms with your IRA provider.  Your estate planning attorney or financial planning professional should be able to set up an IRA beneficiary Trust and assist in completing beneficiary designation forms.

The IRA Beneficiary Trust is an excellent estate planning tool for many estates.  But there are a number of factors to evaluate to determine if this is right for your estate.  These factors include the size of the IRA, whether or not your beneficiaries can properly manage the IRA, the spending habits of the beneficiaries, and potential for creditors of the beneficiaries."

7291,realestateinvesting,"Stuck in rut, need some advice about career change into real estate investing...","Some background:  

I'm an IT Manager by trade (My day job).  I have been in IT for over 12 years now give or take.  I also have 4 rental properties.  I started acquiring properties 11 years ago with my first house.  I bought another one and rented that one out.  It went well, so when mortgages were easy I took advantage and bought 2 more houses.  The second one was purchased right before the market fell and they started cracking down, and wouldn't give 100% financing loans anymore etc.  So I managed these for a while, then a couple years ago I moved again and kept that property as a rental, now I have 4.  

Time has passed and I've paid off the second mortgages on the ones that had one, and refinanced to lower rates on all of them to where I have just under $1000 / month cash flow positive at the end of every month.  

I have a small savings accumulated, a few thousand dollars, $25,000 or so in an IRA, my wife has about $40,000 in our IRA, and we have a fair amount of equity between the rental houses.  

***Now about the rut***:

I say I am in a rut, because outside of managing these properties and sticking with my day job to make money to support my family and pay the other bills, I don't see what my next step should be.  I would like to acquire more properties, and some day transition into the real estate market in some capacity full time, but I don't see how to do that, and have been struggling with it for a while.  

I have my Brokers license and am currently active, though I don't work with any clients or do any sales because I am working full time.  I have 2 small children, so my spare time is rather thin, outside of quitting my job I am not sure how to transition into the next phase of this 'plan'.  

I had a pretty big influx of cash a couple years ago and I wanted to take the opportunity to pay off some debt and use the rest to live on while I transitioned into real estate sales, but at the same time my wife became pregnant with our second kid so I opted to stay working to have a stable paycheck.  

I did use that cash to pay off all CC debt, and pay off all the second mortgages and buy our current house with a 30% down payment.  This has helped keep our house payment low, and helped with the added cash flow from the rentals.  

Anyone been in this situation, transitioned into full time real estate investing / sales?  Anyone currently struggling with this who can share the pain?

TL;DR - I'm in IT, want to be in Real Estate, not sure how to switch without losing my house....  "

7301,realestateinvesting,Advice on how to proceed on making this scenario a purchase?,"There is an owner trying to sell their house and accompanying land in a quick sale. The  total price is $95,000. Normally the house in my market would go for about $85,000. This property comes with about 8 acres of cleared farm land that can be resold for more than this persons asking price. With time and patience, I believe that this property has potential (if there exists a method in which I can purchase it).


I've seen on reddit similar advice, and heard from a broker about how the best sells are from, as I quote, ""motivated sellers.  If you have someone (likely in distress financially) motivated, they will sign whatever you require them to.  The fact that they have someone paying that payment for them is usually enough for the motivated seller."" This is part of an email a broker sent who was giving me advice. Is there any way in which I can take over the payments that this person owes which out having to spend large amounts of money up front?

I am still very new to this. The other properties that I have gotten have been owner financed  for a set term with the goal of refinancing them through a bank at a later term (I look for houses that would appraise for a lot more than the seller is asking for, this is probably elementary for most of you (but I am still new to this)). To be able to look at the above scenario, I need to find a different method of acquiring it (assuming it can be done). Any advice is greatly appreciated."
7302,realestateinvesting,Countertop Trends Of Today,
7303,realestateinvesting,Getting started.,"Howdy all!  I’m about to take the plunge into real estate and wanted to pass my situation by this sub to see if anyone had any feedback for me.  I have been an apartment manager for the past 15 years and I’ve finally started to get serious about investing for my future.  I live in San Francisco, make a programmer’s wage, don’t pay rent, have no debt, and understand the ins and outs of managing 15 to 30 unit buildings very well.  It seems like the only thing wrong with my situation is that I’ve waited until my 30s to start investing in real estate.

When I first started looking around it became painfully clear that I wouldn’t be able to invest in San Francisco anytime soon, so I started looking around my very small home town in Michigan.  I come from a county of about 17,000 people.  There’s about 3 apartment complexes in town and all of them are full with a waiting list.  One of my cousins has a rental property and she has no trouble renting it out.  I also have my entire family still living in this town and they would help me manage any properties that I own.  I even have a brother that does building inspections for the state. 

After searching around a bit I was able to find a house, off market, that’s been completely remodeled.  It’s very nice inside and is a two story 3 bed, 1 bath.  My cousin and real estate agent (friend of the family) have both told me that I could probably get around $750 per month for it.  The only problem is the owner is asking way too much for it at $89,900.  I submitted my offer for it today at $65,000.  The highest I will go is $75,000, but I don’t know if he will come down that far.  

I’m very hopeful that I’ll be able to get this property.  I’m able to put down 25% (the better part of my liquid assets) and then make huge payments on it and probably have it paid off in two years.  Is that the best approach to take?  If everything goes well at what point do I start looking for my second property?  I read one article that talked about the “snowball method”, which resonated with me very strongly.

So tell me /r/realestateinvesting, if my end goal is to eventually support myself with my own property management company what is the most efficient way to get started?

I am considering purchasing a rental property on the local university campus (University of Delaware). I have tons of questions so bare with me and help where you can:

1) Can I purchase in my name and then transfer the ownership to a LLC or should I start the LLC first?
2) What are the major differences in the loans (rates, terms etc.) in purchasing an investment property versus an owner occupied property. Do they evaluate the potential rental income?
3) What are some red flags to watch out for

4) House price: The house was bought in 2006 by the current owner for 132k they are asking 140k now but this is down from 165k in July. Looking at the best comps and comparing on a $/sqft basis the price SHOULD be ~95k. Rental for the house should bring in ~1k/month and I dont expect occupancy issues as this is a healthy and growing campus. There is a current tenant renting month-to-month for 850 who knows the owner but its a 2 bed 1 bath that I believe should be earning more. It is zoned to have up to 4 renters. 

Obviously the owner would appear to upside down on the house with too high of expectations, its been on the market for over 150 days with multiple price reductions. What do you think of the opportunity and my chances of getting a realistic price. Do you think the return would be worth it? Taxes are relatively low in this area. 

EDIT: I have the capability to make a cash offer which i would then try to finance if accepted. I did this with my own home and it helped me get a good deal and we didnt experience any issues. Do you think there would be a problem doing the same with a rental?"

Assuming 25% down, your debt service alone would be more than 14k a year, plus say 4k in taxes. That means 26,400 - 18k = $7-8k a year for everything else - insurance, maintenance, capex, vacancy, utilities, etc.   
  
Are these buyers operating at a loss or just breaking even, and expecting to profit when they sell? Or just expecting the equity gain to be worth it?  I'm having trouble making the numbers work at a purchase price of 200k for monthly rent like that. I analyzed one with taxes of only $2500, and at a 200k purchase, 25% down, plus reasonable yearly expenses, only seeing $2-3k in cash flow.

------------------------------

Many of you are beginning to pull your taxes together and talk to your tax preparer. Those of you that attended the Advanced Strategies Conference in January know that many preparers are planning to file IRS Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, for their clients.  This is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking. I have heard quotes that this one form could double tax preparation cost for a client. But what many preparers were missing is the fact that these smaller clients had never adopted a formal accounting method.  So, this was not a change of accounting method.  

Indeed, the IRS has now agreed and specifically discusses this issue in their updated (as of March 13, 2015) Tangible Property Regulations FAQ. The regulations took effect in 2014 and allow individuals and companies an automatic write-off for small purchases and improvements that otherwise would need to be capitalized. 

Businesses with certified financial statements can elect to deduct items costing up to $5,000. For companies without audited statements, the threshold  is $500. There is also discussion by the IRS on increasing the $500 cap in the future. The IRS FAQ referred to above covers the elections taxpayers can make, such as deducting low-cost items and routine maintenance as well as how to differentiate between repairs and improvements.   

The FAQs state that you should attach a statement titled ""Section 1.263(a)-1(f) de minimis safe harbor election"" to a timely filed federal tax return including extensions for the taxable year in which the de minimis amounts are paid. The statement should include your name, address, and Taxpayer Identification Number, as well as a statement that you are making the de minimis safe harbor election. For some elections, a description of the property will be needed.  

Under the election, you must apply the de minimis safe harbor to all expenditures meeting the criteria for the election in the taxable year. 

As an example, if you qualify and desire to use the de minimis safe harbor election for qualifying amounts paid during your annual taxable year beginning Jan. 1, 2014, you must file a statement with your timely filed original federal tax return for 2014.
An annual election is not a change in method of accounting. Therefore, you should not file Form 3115, Application for Change in Method of Accounting, to use the de minimis safe harbor for a particular tax year, and you should not file a Form 3115 to change the amount you deduct under your book policy. Similarly, you should not file a Form 3115 to stop applying the de minimis safe harbor for a subsequent tax year.  

If your tax preparer is still insisting on filing a Form 3115, send him or her this newsletter!"

My main takeaways are that his views are too simple/narrow but they could be summed up as:

- Don't forget about Capex dumb - dumb
- You need at least $1k a month or so for rent to cashflow after Capex accruals

Focusing on purchase price is stupid for his argument because he seems to argue more for a ""minimum needed rent."" According to his argument any house will have a minimum of $250/month capex (and will have higher taxes, insurance, etc). In fact repairs and capex will likely be more expensive in a higher value house.

Option 1. Great school district with great assigned schools (Elementry, Middle and High). Overpriced because of the community and school proximity ($150 per sqft). Smaller living space (1870 sqft). A more refined neighborhood with bigger front roads. Slightly outside budget for the buyer. Very little flexibility to do changes to the plan. 

Option 2.   Not so great school district. Great value for the location ($110 per sqft). Bigger living space (2400 sqft). Within the budget. Great flexibility to do changes to the floor plan. Great finish (kitchen cabinets, counter tops, appliances etc). Seller will cover closing costs.

7372,realestateinvesting,Final Deal of 2014. Owner Financed SFH.,"2014 was an interesting year...it also reminded me why I typically don’t take on large rehab projects! More on that later (and proof everyone makes mistakes).

The third and final home I bought in 2014 was brought to me by one of my favorite sources of deals...a handyman! Anyone and everyone I come in contact with who works on homes in some way, shape or form I ask to bird dog for me. So much of real estate investing is, “duh” and common sense. Who better to find leads then individuals who work on dozens if not hundreds of homes per year?

This particular handyman was working on a rehab project for me and one day when I was checking on progress he said he had found a property. I asked him a few basic questions: What area was it in? Good area...check. Why is the owner selling? “She hates her family.”

BINGO! What I look for! A challenge I can possibly solve! My handyman hands me the number and I make a call to the owner and setup a meeting.

To meet the Seller for the first time, I end up driving out to a strange area with a combination of nice, modest, modern homes and quite frankly, crappy trailers. The Seller lives not in one of the crappy trailers, but in a crappy RV in front of a crappy trailer. I drive a beater truck when I’m doing anything real estate related but my vehicle is in better shape than anything in this yard...and possibly the only running vehicle.

I get out of my vehicle and a couple of small dogs come running up. The door to the RV pops open and a lady in her early 60’s pops her head out and says (insert Southern accent), “Come on in!.” This was my introduction to the Seller.

Upon entering the RV I’m reminded of the line from the movie Van Wilder as his professor survey’s Van’s dorm room…”Just as I expected, decorated in early F--k.” That being said, I’m here to buy a house, not judge, although I’m rapidly beginning to wonder about the quality of this home and if I had recorded the address of the property we were to be discussing incorrectly. I also note that it is about ninety-five degrees and the AC is not on.

The Seller is actually a bit of a fireball. Fast talking, definitely sharp and definitely pissed off. Long story short, she has a 3/1 block house, in a decent neighborhood, with a 1000sq ft., unfinished addition. She tells me that the house is in rough condition and will require some work. WIthout being asked she volunteers that the house is owned free and clear. Also without prompting, she shares why she wants to sell.

Apparently, a year prior, the Seller allowed her granddaughter, her granddaughter’s boyfriend and their six kids from multiple relationships move into the house. They had agreed to pay her THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH for a house that should likely rent for $1100. They paid her exactly once and had then lived in the house for the past year...even after the Seller spent $9,000 to put in a brand new septic tank. Wow. So the Seller was done.

I rank Sellers on scale of 1-10 with a 7 and up being people who are genuinely interested in selling. This lady was about a 9. The only way the opportunity could have been better would be if she offered me money to take the house. She very well may have if she had any!

I ask if we can see the house that day and she says sure! The Seller is quite happy she is going to take me there to scare her granddaughter. She then informs me that (remember what I said about their vehicles at the beginning) her car doesn’t work because the radiator has a hole in it, so I will have to drive.

***Part 2***

The subject property was about ten minutes away. It rapidly became apparent this a prime example of ""worst house in a decent neighborhood"". The property is located on a cul-de-sac of about sixteen to twenty homes and the rest of them have mowed grass, wood fences, decent exteriors and good vehicles in front of them. Solid middle class neighborhood...although this is the South in a non-metropolitan area so of course one neighbor is proudly celebrating his heritage and has a Confederate Flag outside of his home.

Contrary to the neighborhood, the subject property is surrounded  by a chain link fence that is falling down, a yard that is bereft of grass from the various dogs that are outside, a pickup truck in questionable running condition and a rough exterior. I'm liking this so far.

The adventure begins with the Seller announcing to the occupants (two adults and six kids) that I'm the ""real estate guy"" and demanding rent they owe her. Awkward. As the Seller walks me through the house, the interior is painted a bright lime green which is broken up by one blinding, hot pink bedroom. All of the interior doors and fixtures are jacked up. The kitchen cabinets, per the Seller, are the original cabinets from the 1960's and quite frankly it is a minor miracle that they are still on the wall. A few cabinet doors are missing and the refrigerator is rusting in place.

I am then led to the addition. A thousand square foot addition had been added to the home and never finished after the Seller's husband became ill about ten years prior. The addition was being used as a massive storage are for debris. As these were actually the belongings of the current inhabitants of the home I'm being polite and not referring to said items as trash. The ceiling in the addition was literally falling down exposing electric (looks up to code at least) wiring and I can see daylight from the outside between the roof joists and exterior walls. Hmm. Mental note to come back with one of my guys and check that.

I do give the Seller complete credit as she honestly and unabashedly pointed out every flaw of the house on the interior. We then headed outside where she proceeded to do the same. The exterior of the home from the street looked like siding and brick which upon closer examination was aluminum siding that may have been older than I am. The exterior block of the home was painted a slightly (just barely) sickening shade of green than the interior. My guess is they didn't have color wheels in the 60's.

After inspecting the house, outside of the roof, I didn't see anything that gave me pause. All the damage was cosmetic although there was a lot of it. A brand new septic system had been installed in the last year. I knew the house was in a decent, if not great school district and the neighborhood was quiet and located near businesses, shopping, etc. This was a home I was interested in if the Seller and I could come to an agreement. So...it was time to talk business.

***Making the Deal***

I drove the Seller back to her Motor home. After she tossed out the dogs and cleared a seat for me amid the mess we got down to business. Well...technically she did. In nine years as of a real estate investor, I've never met someone so ready to sell. So I asked, ""What do you believe is a fair price on this house?""

The Seller pulled out a copy of the last assessment of the property and said, ""The County says it is worth $70,000, so I'd like $70,000.""

Now I was a bit surprised, in the good way. If the house had been in decent shape, I would have pegged it at a 100k-110k value. One of the small annoyances as a real estate investor the last three or four years is a Seller who hands me a print out from Zillow and says, ""My home is worth a billion dollars according to Zillow."" Not so much.

I told the Seller, ""I agree that is a fair price. However would you agree the home requires some work?"" The Seller agreed. I said, ""My estimate is it will cost $20,000 to make your house right. Would you split that cost with me?"" The Seller agreed she thought that was fair. ***Side Note*** I don't BS on repair costs. My guess was this would be $15,000 in repairs and there are always extra costs you don't anticipate.

One of the great tips I picked up from the real estate investors I spend time with who are old timers...individuals who have been doing this for thirty, forty or even fifty years...involves making the deal with a Seller. This tip is, when negotiating with a Civilian aka a non-investor Seller, you as the investor are considered the expert. If you ever get taken to court for ""taking advantage"" of someone, it makes sense that even if the Seller had agreed to the terms at one time, you could be made to look like a predator. So what is the tip? Simply have the Seller write all the terms of the sale on a piece of paper (I always have a big yellow notepad), sign and date it. The theory is if you have a handwritten outline of the terms by a Seller, it is much harder for them to say they didn't understand as opposed to showing up to court with a typical contract (although we do execute one of those based on the notes I make with the Seller).

So in this instance I have the Seller write down:

Property Value: $70,000

Repair Credit: $10,000

Sale Price: $60,000

At this point in time we are both happy with the price, now we have to figure out payment terms. I ask the Seller if she would be happy with $5,000 down. This elicited an almost instantaneous yes. So on the notepad we wrote:

Property Value: $70,000

Repair Credit: $10,000

Sale Price: $60,000

Downpayment: $5,000

Balance: $55,000.

When fixed up, I estimated this home would rent for $1000-$1100 a month since we would be finishing the addition by adding a large Master Bedroom turning the home in a Four Bedroom house. As an investor, I'm conservative so I took the lowest number of $1000 a month in gross rents. I guessed my taxes would be about $150 a month and insurance $100 a month which took my down to $750 left over. Since I like to make $300 a month net, that left me with $450 in wiggle room for monthly payments to the Seller.

At this point in time, I asked the Seller if there was anything in the house the was hers. ""Oh yes"" she replied, ""I would like to get my pool table, my refrigerator, my grill and a few other odds and ends."" I asked how she planned on moving all of these items. She replied, ""I have a storage unit but I don't know how I will move all of this."" A perfect opportunity to provide a small favor!

At this point in time I told the Seller that since she was being fair to me, I'd like to do something nice for her. ""If we can figure out an agreement that makes sense to both of us today, I'll get my guys to move all of your stuff for you.""

""That would be wonderful!"", the Seller said.

So now that the Seller was happy I asked a pertinent question. ""You said your Granddaughter was supposed to pay you $300 a month. Why this amount?""

""Oh that is all I need to live on.""

I said, ""Well, I'd like to make certain you have a little bit extra, if I was willing to pay you $400 a month until that $55,000 was paid off, would that make you happy?""

""That would be wonderful!""

So back to the notepad:

Property Value: $70,000

Repair Credit: $10,000

Sale Price: $60,000

Downpayment: $5,000

Balance: $55,000.

Payments: $400 a month until paid in full.

At this point, I was quite happy. One of the investors I look up to always taught me, ""When a deal is good enough in real estate, you take it. No reason to squeeze blood out of someone."" Based on how badly the Seller wanted to sell, I suspect I could have knocked the price of the house down another $10,000 or maybe even $20,000. There was no reason to. I had what I wanted.

There was one last item. I was in the  middle of rehabbing another property and wanted to delay my payments by 90-Days. 

So I said to the Seller, ""I remember you telling my your AC was out and your car required a new radiator. We've got a deal that we are both happy with but I'm working on another house at the moment. Would you be willing to delay the start of payments by 90-Days if I found you a working AC unit for your Motorhome and a new radiator for your car?""

She asked if she was going to get the $5,000 down payment up front of would she have to wait?

""No ma'am, you will receive the $5,000 up front and your monthly payments will start in 90 Days.""

She asked, ""Could you drop that to 60 Days?""

I agreed this was fair. So out came the notepad...

Property Value: $70,000

Repair Credit: $10,000

Sale Price: $60,000

Downpayment: $5,000

Balance: $55,000.

Payments: $400 a month until paid in full. Payments to begin in Sixty (60) Days.

Buyer will provide Seller with new radiator for car and working AC unit for Motorhome.

At this point in time the Seller and I both signed and dated the page and our agreement was in place.

7406,realestateinvesting,My boring (but good return) investment story.,"I thought I'd share my non-creative (bank loan) story.

I receive automatic emails from my real estate agent for anything in my area that is under $40,000. A nice looking 3br 1.5 bath for $24,900 came up and I jumped on it.

We went and looked at the property, and it has a dated look, but everything functions well and we figured we could fix a couple of windows, put in a new furnace and be ready for a tenant to move in.

There were a couple of snags in the process as there always seems to be when we buy a property (but that's another couple stories). When we had the water turned on during the inspection we found that one of the water pipes had burst while the home had been vacant. Luckily the previous owner had done some work in order to get rid of the old cast iron pipe, and it only took a couple hours and 20ft of pipe to replace all of the old pipe. The 100 yr old foundation had a crack in it that the appraiser didn't like, so we had to have a contractor write a letter telling the bank it was acceptable.

We offered $24,900 with the seller paying $2500 closing costs. There were multiple offers and we offered our best at $24,900+ $1500 closing costs. We found out a day before the (delayed) closing that the type of loan our bank gave us only allowed for 2% of the total cost of the property to be covered by the seller. This meant they could only pay $498. The bank waived their origination fee as they had made the mistake, but that still left us an extra $1000 to pay.

Anyway the deal breaks down like this:

$6759.16 for down payment, insurance, taxes, inspections, etc
$3498 for new furnace install
$400 maintenance - windows, pipe, cleaning

$10657.16 total out of pocket.

We bought it Nov 21 and have it rented as of today for $680/mo gross.  
Net is 483/mo after principal, interest, insurance, and taxes. Maintenance isn't figured in."
7407,realestateinvesting,Is Commercial Real Estate Investing for You?,
7408,realestateinvesting,10 things I wish I knew before starting real estate investing,
7409,realestateinvesting,Advice wanted on purchasing a house I am leading now.,"I will try to keep this brief but thorough in facts:

-Been leasing 3 years. 
-Owner is nice but very intelligent, owned many homes. 
-Seems to be worth 179k -186k based on comps
-area has relatively low days on market 30-60
-gated community, growing area (2 new construction subdivisions opening in next year. Couple thousand homes.  It's the lower end of a high end community.  Some houses are worth 450k+

He says he would sell it to me or on the market.  Either way he will sell ""buy owner"".  He believe he can sell buy owner and get at least 180k on the market.  Does not suspect he would need to pay much in repairs/ upgrades to sell for market value.  

I am trying to get a deal since I live here and he won't have to put it on the market.  Because of this I feel there are financial benefits to him to sell to me at a lower price.  

At first I suspected he would have an RE agent... But that's gone. So $10k in expected fees wouldn't be in effect. Then there are the repairs / maint. 

- big oak tree needs trimmed badly 
- at least 1 good lawn / shrub clean up
- one side of house has shitty paint touch up that needs to be pained or something 
- bad need if pressure wash on house. Mold on gutters etc. (not part of my rent responsibility) 
- 2 windows don't open / close right 
- dishwasher is shitty / dying 
- one window has a crack/ small

There are other cosmetic things someone could fix or not.  Holes in porch screen, missing screens on windows. Nothing crazy but not perfect.  


Basically he is offering to sell to me at $180k.  I feel I can get a better deal considering he won't have to do the work, pay at least 1 mortgage payment nor deal with the ""buy owner "" shit. Besides repair costs. 

Lastly I know there are houses in the area that are upgraded on floors and kitchens. This house is a builder standard.  No upgrades. Cheap appliances. Cheap paint. Cheap carpet. No crown molding or fancy doors.  Just the builder basic.  I can get a top end upgrade for $190-195k which if don't here would cost me at least 20k minimum. Even doing some of my own labor. 

I am awaiting him to counter offer. I offered $165k based on assuming he would use a realtor.  Which he says he won't. 


Ok this ended up long.  So questions:

Assuming on what I wrote is $180 a good  deal? 

What else might you say to get this? 

Is he being unreasonable or am I?

Might he be playing ""hard ball""? 

Other thoughts? Tips? Advice? 


Thanks SO much for taking the time to read this and hopefully reply!!!

7413,realestateinvesting,Tricky situation. need advice,"My mother and I purchased a duplex in TX in 2012. I lived in one side while we rented the other. My mother acted as a silent partner and let me claim the rent and depreciation for the rental side on my taxes, while she would make her investment back when we sold the duplex.

Now we are in the process of selling and have run into an issue. We initially thought that we would be able to split the profits any way we chose, allowing me to take 80% and her 20%. I would then roll my portion into another house for me and she would do what she wanted with hers. But it seems in reality we have to split the profits 50-50 for tax purposes, leaving me with a lot less money to reinvest in my next house. My mother is willing to roll her portion over in a 1031 to help cover my down payment, but the catch is she did not claim any portion of the rental on her own taxes, so we are unsure if she is able to do that.

My question is: is there a way to structure this situation that would keep us from having to pay cap gains on her portion of the sale and allow us to reinvest together in another house?"

7419,realestateinvesting,3/2 Cash w/ Creative Adventures,"**3/2 Rehab House Deal w/ Private Money Adventures**

This was my second deal of 2014.

Initially the subject property was brought to my attention by another investor I am friendly with. This particular investor controls a number of properties in his own portfolio but is also an active wholesaler. Of particular note, he is the only wholesaler that I’ve encountered in my investing career who understands the value of terms deals. Prior to this opportunity, I’ve acquired two properties through him and we tend to speak a couple times a week about various opportunities we are both working on. 


**Real estate is a RELATIONSHIP based business. Learn to create relationships with Sellers, Renters and Scouts and you will have consistent opportunities brought to you**

The home was originally available for 15k cash. Initially I ignored the opportunity as the the name for the area in which the property was located didn’t ring a bell. Roughly thirty days later my buddy again emails me regarding the property but this time included a note mentioning it is very close to another area where I control several other properties. I pull up Google Maps and wouldn’t you know it? Five minutes from other properties I control but the area has a different name.


A few days later I had the opportunity to take a look at the property so I picked up a member of my maintenance team and headed on over. I was told the property required about $8,000 in rehab and I’ve found it useful to have another set of eyes looking for challenges with any potential acquisition. As we get closer to the property, my maintenance guy mentions, “Hey...my Uncle lives near here.” We pull up to the property and as luck would have it, not only does his Uncle live NEXT DOOR to the property, he has keys to the house! Score!


We start our inspection of the property and it is in an interesting state of cosmetic rehab and major rehab.


**Yard:**


The yard itself is of decent sized and enclosed by a chain link fence. The fence has a few small challenges here or there but nothing we can’t easily fix. The grass, shrubs and trees can all use a good trimming. Spending a little time cleaning up the yard will make a big difference.

**Home Exterior:**


On one side of the house is a “Car Port” which is more of a large, enclosed storage shed which is beginning to rot. We will be tearing this down as it abuts the house and is an easy ingress for pests to make it into the main home. One side of the house has serious wood rot and to make the home rent ready by my standards I decide to tear that side apart and redo it.

Electrical has been cut from the home which isn’t a huge loss since it was substandard. The home does not have central ac but there is a great crawl space under the house and a huge attic space so we will most likely install it now or at some point in time in the future.

A few windows are broken and the exterior paint is faded. The roof is metal and relatively new. No deal breakers here.

**Home Interior:**


The home is an old, frame house that was moved from another location to the current lot. It is decent sized at 1350sq ft. As it was only moved in the last fifteen years or so, the piers that the home is resting on are still VERY stable. The home has beautiful hardwood floors that are in amazing shape outside of requiring a good sand, seal and buff. The floors of the house are very firm...no give. I’m a tall and solid guy at 6’6”, 240 pounds so if the floor doesn’t move with my fat ass jumping up and down on it, I’m satisfied with the structural integrity of them.


The walls are authentic wood paneling which we will most likely carefully remove and sell or donate. The kitchen is on the small side but there is a nice, screened in front porch, a back porch/utility room and a nice living room. The three bedrooms are all fair sized with a bathroom in each. The bathroom in the front bedroom is poorly conceived so we may end up pulling it out. Another positive is the home included a very new water heater.


**Additional observations:**


I would consider this a good working class neighborhood: Residents probably make 30k a year and keep their homes maintained or are retired. The schools are ok, there is a nice park a few houses down and prices in this area are trending up. I decide to acquire this property if I can get terms that are desirable to me. Rehabbed I would value this property at 60k and I expect it would rent for $800-$850 a month.


The current asking price for this deal is $15,000. With an estimated $12,000 in rehab to make rent ready, I’d own a $60,000 property free and clear for $27,000 and I’d net about $600 a month off it. At those numbers, I’d be looking at a 27% one year cash on cash return. Not too bad. While the home is a decent deal for someone willing to do rehab, of course I have to see if we can make it better.


**Negotiating terms:** 


After conducting my due diligence my belief is the rehab will cost more than the $8.000 it was originally marketed at. I offer $10,000 for the property. The counter comes back at $12,000 + I pay all closing costs. I’m satisfied with this as my closing costs amount to $694.


By negotiating even this small amount, I’ve now increased my cash on cash return slightly to 29%. By negotiating the price down an extra couple of thousand dollars, it also allows me to spend a bit more on the rehab of the property if I choose and still have the original 27% one year cash on cash return.


**Additional Challenges Looming:**
 
1. In exactly sixty days I owe one of my private investors $15,000 to pay off a loan.


2. I’m also negotiating two nicer properties that require minimal rehab (&lt;$2,000) but the down payments would be a combined $15,000 to $20,000 out of my pocket to purchase.

So as things stand, this is what my potential financials look like in the next sixty days.


New Home Purchase (Property A): 12k


Rehab Costs (Property A): 12k


Debt to Private Money Lender in 60 Days: 15k


Down Payments for two other properties: 20k


Total Expenses: 59k OOP


I don’t like coming out of pocket for this much cash so I have to come up with a way to use as little of my own capital as possible. Even better, how can I do this while increasing my own net worth and monthly cash flow?


**Important Rule of Real Estate Investing: Having a part of something, is better than having all of nothing!**

Step 1: Funding the new property and eliminating my obligation to a private investor.


The private investor I owe 15k to in 60-days has a brother who has been interested in joining us in our real estate adventures. I pitch this as the perfect opportunity for all three of us to participate in an opportunity together (We have a solid Land Trust and Venture Agreement outlining all responsibilities and contingencies).


Brother #1 who is new to  RE investing, agrees to put up $12,000 for a 33% share of the property. This covers the purchase price of the property.


Brother #2 has invested with me four or five times and was ready to own an actual property instead of continuing to play private bank. I ask him to forgive $12,000 (the same amount as his brother) in return for a 33% share of the property. I would then pay him $3,000 in cash in order to balance out the $15,000 I owed him.


I am responsible for $12,000 in rehab  costs on the property for my 33% share.


**The Numbers:**


So what are the numbers? We own the property free and clear. So for $12,000 in capital, we each have an estimated $20,000 in equity post-rehab. However, you can’t eat equity and net worth is an exercise in ego. There are plenty of high net worth individuals with no liquidity. So what is our one year return on investment?


$800 - $170 (estimated monthly taxes and insurance) = $630/3 = $210 each a month. $210 x 12 months = $2520 / $12,000 = 21% one year cash on cash return. Not great by my standards if I was purchasing this house just for myself, but three partners each receiving 21% one year cash on cash return? Not too shabby and it would make most people happy.


**So what do my new numbers look like?**


New Home Purchase (Property A): 12k (Paid for by Brother #1)


Rehab Costs (Property A): 12k


Debt to Private Money Lender in 60 Days: 15k 3k (Exchanged 12k in debt for equity in property)


Down Payments for two other properties: 20k


Total Expenses: 35k OOP


I’ve now REDUCED my potential capital outlay by $14,000 while INCREASING my net worth by $20,000 and INCREASING my monthly cash flow by $210 once the new property can be rehabbed.


Personally, I acquired the vast majority of my knowledge as a real estate investor by listening to and reading about how others constructed their deals. I hope that providing real life examples of what I am doing that I will be able to share with others and inspire them to do the same.


At about this same time, opportunity struck in a big way.


While negotiating all of the particulars of this opportunity, one of my handymen gave me a lead that turned into GOLD. I was given the opportunity to buy a $105,000 house (Property B)for $60,000 with $5,000 down. I’ll detail how that opportunity came to pass in my next deal post but for now, I decided to raise some more capital.


Why? The once a year, awesome deal was going to set me back $15,000 to $20,000. As such, I chose once again to raise some capital instead of coming out of pocket for the expenses. How do I accomplish this?


Developing and making use of private money sources to raise capital is a win/win situation for any investor. I called one of my private money sources and ask them to loan me 10k out of their Roth Self Directed IRA. In return for this loan, I offer them 25% of the net cash flow of a house (Property C) I own free and clear. This returns tax free, into their self directed IRA, a return of 18% a year. Why am I being so generous?


1) The house I am giving them cash flow from I have controlled for years and it has paid for itself many times over.


2) This private money source has backed me on several other deals and I enjoy assisting the people who assist me.


3) *IMPORTANT* Note that I am receiving a $10,000 LOAN from the self directed Roth IRA. This means I do not pay taxes on it. In a year I will be selling the property they are loaning against at which time I will return their 10k.


**So what do my new numbers look like?**

New Home Purchase: 12k (Paid for by Brother #1)


Rehab Costs: 12k - 10k Roth IRA Loan secured by another property = 2k


Debt to Private Money Lender in 60 Days: 15k 3k (Exchanged 12k in debt for equity in property)


Down Payment + Rehab for two other properties new, GOLD opportunity: 20k


Total Expenses: 25k OOP


On the surface I’ve cut my OOP expenses by  close to 60% which is a righteous cause for celebration. However let’s REALLY look at the numbers and see the magic of how this deal is structured!


Of the three properties that eventually played a part in in this adventure, I owned one of them (Property C) free and clear. This is the property that I eventually sold a 25% interest in the net cash flow of to the Roth Self Directed IRA.


So prior to this deal a single free and clear home, Property C, was netting me $500 a month.


**After completing all of the deals in this post, here is what I end up  with:**

75% of Property C net cash flow = $500 x .75 = $375


100% of Property B ownership = Estimated equity post rehab is $70,000 and estimated net cash flow is $500.


33% of Property A ownership = Estimated equity post rehab of $20,000 and estimated net cash flow of $210.

PRIOR to these deals I had a net cash flow of $500 from Property C + my equity in property C.

AFTER these deals I have a net cash flow of $1085 ($375 + $500 + $210) and additional equity of $90,000 ($70,000 + $20,000).

My total OOP expenses have been reduced to $25,000 so my one year cash on cash return on that money is: $1085 x 12 = $13,020/$25,000 = 52%


Now I’m certain someone, somewhere is going to cry that I should be including the $10,000 loan on Property C in my expenses. I disagree as that loan is specifically being paid off by the eventual sale of Property C and has nothing to do with my current OOP expenses in this scenario. However, let’s look at the one year cash and cash with another $10,000 thrown in there.


$1085 x 12 = $13,020 / ($25,000 + $10,000) = 37% one year cash on cash return. For new investors or for those who don’t understand investing outside of financial institutions and 20% down payments, most investors would kill for a 37% one year return...and as noted I consider this deal in actuality a 52% one year cash on cash return


That ladies and gentlemen is what I mean when I say you don’t find good opportunities, you CREATE them. And this is why I love real estate!

My goal each year is to buy five solid houses that will generate a minimum net cash flow of $300 a month  each. I structure these deals in order to return my initial investment as quickly as possible. I strive for a 40% one year cash on cash return although for the right house, in the right neighborhood, I’d settle for as low as a 20%.

**The Property:**

3/1 Block home with fenced back yard and shed. New Roof (Less than 5 years old,) New Septic System (Less than 5 years old). Located in a quiet neighborhood primarily occupied by retirees who purchased their homes in the 60’s and 70’s. An additional benefit of this neighborhood is the location places it in the district of the BEST elementary school in the area. Furthermore the property is within walking distance of a large playground and several nice lakes.

**How Was the Property Located:**


The opportunity was initially brought to me by a *Wholesaler.

**The Seller “Why”:**


The Seller had bought this property to be an “investor”. However he had a poor property management system in place which led to two bad tenants in a row. This was an instance of a “Problem Property” to another Landlord who had been emotionally drained and was looking for a solution to get out of the property.

**The Terms:**


I did not negotiate the terms on this property. The subject property had minimal equity (Estimated $5,000) and the Wholesaler had negotiated a Subject-To deal as the terms. The total amount of cash required for a closing was almost exactly $6,000 and included closing costs, Wholesaler Fee and a small amount to the Seller.

The monthly mortgage payment on the property including PITI was $680.40. The balance of the loan at the time of acquiring the property Subject-To was slightly over $69,000 with comps showing the property to be estimated at $75,000.

My rent estimate for this property was between $1000-$1100 a month. As I’m very conservative with my numbers, I used the lowest estimate as the basis for deciding if this property would cash flow the amount I desired. $1000 monthly rent - $680.40 mortgage payment = $320 net profit per month give or take a few cents.

*This particular Wholesaler is smart in that if they cannot get a good cash deal on a property, they attempt to negotiate terms.

 
**The Inspection:**


Prior to going under contract, I inspected the neighborhood and property. Pulling up to the home I noticed the roof did indeed look new. The driveway was in good shape and the exterior of the house was nice. There was actually some semblance of curb appeal due to landscaping.

Inside the house, the paint was also in good shape. With the except of the bedrooms, the floors were tile. There was one cracked tile in the bathroom and one missing tile between two of the bedrooms. The third bedroom was actually a garage converted to a bedroom, big closet and laundry room. It was a little awkward but not to the point it would keep someone from living there. The kitchen was nice and relatively modern and there as a small dining room attached to it. Sale of the house included a nice refrigerator and stove.

The backyard of the house was in acceptable condition. There was a fair amount of debris in the yard that had to be removed. The fence was in acceptable condition also. Not great but not horrible. The shed left a little to be desirable but was serviceable. Overall, the house easily passed my visual inspection. I would grade it to be in B condition meaning I estimated any repairs to be cosmetic in value and to cost less than $3,000 to be rent ready.

Any time I consider purchasing a home in a new area, the neighborhood is more important than the house. I’m looking for areas in which I will purchase more homes over time, preferably controlling several homes on the same street or within several blocks of each other. This means finding out if the neighborhood will likely continue to be desirable for ten or more years.

The best way I’ve found to accomplish this goal is to walk around the neighborhood and talk to people. As luck would have it, the neighbor directly across the street was exactly who I wanted to find. A long time resident of the neighborhood AND nosey. If you make this type of neighbor your friend and tell them that if they EVER have a problem with your tenants, that you will take care of it, they will watch your house better than any private security force ever would.

By speaking with this neighbor I found out a great deal about the neighborhood and area...all good. One surprise bonus was discovering that this neighborhood had exclusive access to a fenced in park and lake. Excellent! Another bonus was the neighbor sharing that she had lived in her house since the late 70’s, the neighbor next to her had just passed away and the neighbor on one side of the house I was interested in had lived there since the early 70’s. This meant I was just given three leads on properties I may be able to acquire in the future!

**Finding Residents:**


I listed the property up for rent at $1000 a month and was inundated with responses. I could have easily rented it for $1100 a month it seems but was more interested in moving in a renter before I had to cover a payment myself. The family I chose to live in the house I did so for two reasons:

1) They have two children. One is five and the other three. This means they could potentially stay for eight years until the youngest finishes elementary school. I like that idea!

2) They had a small dog which is an additional $25 per month in pet fees.


**Final Numbers:**


$1025 Monthly Rent - $680.40 Monthly Mortgage = $345 a month in Net Rents (give or take a few cents).

$6000 in closing costs/fees + $3000 in cleaning up the place (materials + labor) = $9,000 Total Invested.

$345 a month net rent x 12 months = $4140 one year net profit divided by $9000 = 46% one year cash on cash return on my investment."
7432,realestateinvesting,"Real Estate ""Gurus"" &amp; Getting Started in Real Estate Investing.","**Gurus/Coaches**

The cold, hard truth about real estate investing is that it is almost impossible to ""get quick rich"". Unfortunately, greed overwhelms common sense in most people and we look for a ""shortcut"" to achieve the life of our dreams. Long story short, if something sounds too good to be true, it most likely is.

The best real estate gurus I've personally met taught a class or seminar no more than four times a year and charged a nominal amount to attend...around $100 for a day. These gurus are too busy being investors to ""coach"" or ""guru"". Ask yourself this question. If someone is teaching dozens or hundreds of classes a year and charging thousands...or even tens of thousands of dollars...for their knowledge. How do you think they REALLY make their money? Real estate investing or ""coaching"".

Should you consider ""coaching"" from a guru, consider asking some, if not all, of following questions:

1. Ask to see proof of their portfolio.


2. Ask how long they have been a real estate investor for.


3. Ask to speak to several of their successful students.


4. Ask AROUND. Chances are if someone has been investing for 30+ years and other experienced investors in your area know of them and speak highly of them, congratulations. You probably found one of the few good ones.


**Getting Started**

So you want to be a real estate investor. Congratulations! Hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people have had this same thought. Over the last ten years the proliferation of ""reality"" TV has made the real estate investing, in particular flipping, ""sexy"". As a result, everyone believes they can do it. The reality is somewhat different.

The truth is real estate investing, when done correctly, isn't difficult from a logical point of view. The challenge, as with most wealth building paths in life, is it takes not only knowledge but significant mental and emotional adjustment. After going through the process of becoming a full time investor over the last ten years and watching hundreds if not thousands of new investors disappear during that time, often without buying even one property. My observation is the emotional adjustments are most difficult challenges to overcome.
